Adam Schiff, D-Calif., a committee member who also leads the House Intelligence Committee. \u201cThere are certain actions, parts of these different lines of effort to overturn the election that I don\u2019t see evidence the Justice Department is investigating.\u201dThe committee held its first public hearing last week, with members laying out their case against Trump to show how the defeated president relentlessly pushed his false claims of a rigged election despite multiple advisers telling him otherwise and how he intensified an extraordinary scheme to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s victory.Additional evidence is set to be unveiled this week in hearings that will demonstrate how Trump and his advisers engaged in a \u201cmassive effort\u201d to spread misinformation and pressured the Justice Department to embrace his false claims.Committee members indicated Sunday their most important audience over the course of the hearings ultimately may be Attorney General Merrick Garland, who must decide whether his department can and should prosecute Trump. They left no doubt their own view as to whether the evidence is sufficient.\u201cOnce the evidence is accumulated by the Justice Department, it needs to make a decision about whether it can prove to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt the president\u2019s guilt or anyone else\u2019s,\u201d Schiff said. \u201cBut they need to be investigated if there\u2019s credible evidence, which I think there is.\u201dRep.

But it is a country where many cherish gun rights and its Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment protects the right to \u201ckeep and bear arms.\u201dWith 10 Republicans signaling support, that would be sufficient to overcome the Senate\u2019s \u201cfilibuster\u201d rule, which requires that 60 of the 100 senators agree to advance most legislation. Republicans opposed to the plan are expected to mount procedural hurdles in a bid to block it.Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell stopped short of embracing the framework.\u201cI am glad Senators Cornyn and Murphy are continuing to make headway in their discussions,\u201d McConnell said in a statement, adding that he hoped the talks make progress on \u201ckey issues like mental health and school safety\u201d in a way that \u201crespects the Second Amendment.\u201dBiden welcomed Sunday\u2019s agreement.\u201cIt does not do everything that I think is needed, but it reflects important steps in the right direction, and would be the most significant gun safety legislation to pass Congress in decades,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cWith bipartisan support, there are no excuses for delay, and no reason why it should not quickly move through the Senate and the House.\u201dDemocratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi last week expressed confidence in the Senate negotiators despite her desire for more-stringent gun restrictions.Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said that he wanted to move a bill quickly once legislative details are worked out.The deal, cobbled together following weeks of intensive negotiations, would provide federal funding to encourage states to adopt \u201cred flag\u201d laws keeping guns out of the hands of those determined by courts to be a significant danger to themselves or others.Congress would provide more funding to expand mental health programs including ones run in schools, and would crack down on those who evade gun licensing requirements or illegally buy guns on behalf of others \u2013 transactions known as \u201cstraw purchases.\u201dThe plan also would require new government checks on those under age 21 who try to buy weapons so that juvenile mental health records can be reviewed, along with checks with state and local law enforcement agencies.\u201cWe\u2019re grateful to the bipartisan group of senators that worked on this compromise. Thank you for finding common ground that saves lives,\u201d said David Hogg, a survivor of a 2018 Florida high school shooting and co-founder of the group that organized Saturday\u2019s rallies.Hogg added that even more is needed including requiring background checks for every gun purchase nationwide, saying the bill \u201cshould be the beginning and not the end of Congress\u2019 work.\u201d(Reporting by Richard Cowan in Washington and Brendan O\u2019Brien in Chicago; Editing by Will Dunham and Scott Malone)", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gun-control-rally-june-11-e1655057514231.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "June 12, 2022 "}, {"title": "Russia unveils McDonald\u2019s substitute: \u2018Tasty and that\u2019s it\u2019", "description": "McDonald\u2019s restaurants opened their doors in Moscow once again on Sunday under new Russian ownership and a new name, \u201cVkusno & tochka,\u201d which translates as \u201cTasty and that\u2019s it.\u201dHere\u2019s what we know:The famous Golden Arches have been taken down and replaced with a new logo, resembling a letter \u201cM,\u201d comprising two fries and a hamburger patty against a green background.Chief executive Oleg Paroev said the new company had settled on the new name \u2013 a closely guarded secret \u2013 only the day before the launch.There was some speculation on social media about how best to translate the new name into English. \u201cTasty and that\u2019s it\u201d was broadly adopted, although another suggestion was: \u2018Tasty. Full stop.\u2019\u201cVkusno & tochka\u201d reopened on Sunday in Pushkin Square in what was McDonald\u2019s first restaurant in Soviet Moscow in 1990, when it sold as many as 30,000 burgers, but the queue outside the restaurant was much smaller than three decades ago.The chain will keep its old McDonald\u2019s interior but will remove any trace of its former name.Initially 15 rebranded restaurants will open in and around the capital and another 200 restaurants by end-June and all 850 by the end of summer, executives said on Sunday.The new owner said up to 7 billion roubles ($126 million) will be invested this year in the business, which employs more than 50,000 people.McDonald\u2019s flagship Big Mac and other burgers and desserts such as McFlurry are missing, but other popular items are on a smaller menu selling at slightly lower prices.A double cheeseburger was going for 129 roubles ($2.31) compared with roughly 160 under McDonald\u2019s and a fish burger for 169 roubles, compared with about 190 previously.Paroev said the chain would keep prices \u201caffordable.\u201d They would likely rise due to inflation, but not higher than its competitors, he said.Most ingredients come from within Russia, but some items weren\u2019t immediately available due to logistical difficulties and because some suppliers have left Russia. For instance, it needs to find a new soft drinks supplier after Coca Cola suspended business there.Siberian businessman Alexander Govor has taken over the franchise operation through his firm GiD LLC. He has been a McDonald\u2019s licensee since 2015 and had helped the chain expand into remote Siberia, where he operated 25 restaurants.McDonald\u2019s will have an option to buy its restaurants in Russia back within 15 years, Russian authorities have said.Govor told reporters on Sunday the price he paid was \u201cfar lower than market price\u201d and had been a \u201csymbolic\u201d figure. The U.S. chain booked a $1.4 billion charge for the deal. McDonald\u2019s did not respond to a request for comment on the price.Russia and Ukraine accounted for about 9%, or $2 billion, of McDonald\u2019s revenue last year.McDonald\u2019s former Russian head Paroev is running the business. Until the takeover, he had worked for McDonald\u2019s for seven years, including as chief financial officer of the Russian business for 6-1/2 years until November 2021, according to his LinkedIn profile.He was appointed Russia McDonald\u2019s CEO in February, weeks before Moscow sent tens of thousands of troops into Ukraine on Feb. 24.Govor will retain the chain\u2019s tens of thousands of employees for at least two years, the U.S. company said.($1 = 55.7500 roubles)Reporting by Reuters Compiled by Josephine Mason Editing by Pravin Char and Frances Kerry", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/2022051606054-62822217d3ae599494f69e7fjpeg.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "June 12, 2022 "}, {"title": "#ChurchToo: Sex abuse revelations continue to grow in U.S. years after movement began", "description": "A withering report on sexual abuse and cover-up in the Southern Baptist Convention, the largest Protestant denomination in the U.S.A viral video in which a woman confronts her pastor at an independent Christian church for sexually preying on her when she was a teen.A TV documentary exposing sex abuse of children in Amish and Mennonite communities.You might call it #ChurchToo 2.0.Survivors of sexual assault in church settings and their advocates have been calling on churches for years to admit the extent of abuse in their midst and to implement reforms. In 2017 that movement acquired the hashtag #ChurchToo, derived from the wider #MeToo movement, which called out sexual predators in many sectors of society.In recent weeks #ChurchToo has seen an especially intense set of revelations across denominations and ministries, reaching vast audiences in headlines and on screen with a message that activists have long struggled to get across.\u201cFor us it\u2019s just confirmation of what we\u2019ve been saying all these years,\u201d said Jimmy Hinton, an advocate for abuse survivors and a Church of Christ minister in Somerset, Pennsylvania. \u201cThere is an absolute epidemic of abuse in the church, in religious spaces.\u201dCalls for reform will be prominent this week in Anaheim, California, when the Southern Baptist Convention holds its annual meeting following an outside report that concluded its leaders mishandled abuse cases and stonewalled victims.The May 22 report came out the same day an independent church in Indiana was facing its own reckoning.Moments after its pastor, John B. Lowe II, confessed to years of \u201cadultery,\u201d longtime member Bobi Gephart took the microphone to tell the rest of the story: She was just 16 when it started, she said.The video of the confrontation has drawn nearly 1 million views on Facebook. Lowe subsequently resigned from New Life Christian Church & World Outreach in Warsaw.In an interview, Gephart said she\u2019s not surprised that so many cases are now coming out. She has received words of encouragement from all over the world, with people sharing their own \u201cheartbreaking\u201d stories of abuse.\u201cThings are shaking loose,\u201d Gephart said. \u201cI really feel like God is trying to make things right.\u201dFor many churches, she said, \u201cIt\u2019s all about covering up, `Let\u2019s keep the show going.\u2019 There are hurting people, and that\u2019s not right. I still don\u2019t think a lot of the church gets it.\u201dHinton _ who turned in his own father, a former minister now imprisoned for aggravated indecent assault _ said the viral video demonstrates the potency of survivors telling their own stories.\u201cSurvivors have far more power than they ever think imaginable,\u201d he said on his \u201cSpeaking Out on Sex Abuse\u201d podcast.#ChurchToo revelations have emerged in all kinds of church groups, including liberal denominations that preach gender equality and depict clergy sexual misconduct as an abuse of power. The Episcopal Church aired stories from survivors at its 2018 General Convention, and an archbishop in the Anglican Church of Canada resigned in April amid allegations of sexual misconduct.But many recent reckonings are occurring in conservative Protestant settings where a \u201cpurity culture\u201d has been prominent in recent decades _ emphasizing male authority and female modesty and discouraging dating in favor of traditional courtship leading to marriage.On May 25 reality TV personality Josh Duggar was sentenced in Arkansas to more than 12 years in prison for receiving child pornography. Duggar was a former lobbyist for a conservative Christian organization and appeared on TLC\u2019s since-canceled \u201c19 Kids and Counting,\u201d featuring a homeschooling family that stressed chastity and traditional courtship. Prosecutors said Duggar had a \u201cdeep-seated, pervasive and violent sexual interest in children.\u201dOn May 26 the Springfield (Missouri) News-Leader reported on a spate of sex abuse cases involving workers at Kanakuk Kamps, a large evangelical camp ministry.Emily Joy Allison, whose abuse story launched the #ChurchToo movement, said the sexual ethic preached in many conservative churches _ and the shame and silence it breeds _ are part of the problem. She argues that in her book, \u201c#ChurchToo: How Purity Culture Upholds Abuse and How to Find Healing.\u201dAllison told The Associated Press that addressing abuse requires both a change in church policy and theology. But she knows the latter is unlikely in the SBC.\u201cThey need to undergo a transformation so radical they would be unrecognizable at the end. And that will not happen,\u201d Allison said. Reform work focused on \u201charm reduction\u201d is a more realistic approach, she said.Some advocates hope the front-burner focus on abuse could lead to lasting reforms _ if not in churches, then in the law.Misty Griffin, an advocate for fellow survivors of sexual assault in Amish communities, recently launched a petition drive seeking a congressional \u201cChild\u2019s Rights Act.\u201d As of early June, it had drawn more than 5,000 signatures.It would require that all teachers, including those in religious schools and homeschool settings, be trained about child abuse and neglect and subject to reporting mandates, and would also require age-appropriate instruction on abuse prevention for students. Griffin said such legislation is crucial because in authoritarian religious systems, victims often don\u2019t know help is available or how to get it.\u201cWithout that, nothing\u2019s going to change,\u201d said Griffin, a consulting producer on the documentary \u201cSins of the Amish.\u201dThe two-episode documentary, which premiered on Peacock TV in May, examines endemic abuse in Amish and Mennonite communities, saying it is enabled by a patriarchal authority structure, an emphasis on forgiving offenders and reluctance to report wrongdoing to law enforcement.The Southern Baptist Convention, whose doctrine also calls for male leadership in churches and families, has been particularly shaken by the #ChurchToo movement after years of complaints that leadership has failed to care for survivors and hold their abusers accountable.At its annual meeting, the SBC will consider proposals to create a task force that would oversee a listing of clergy credibly accused of abuse. But survivors criticized that proposal and are calling for a more powerful and independent commission to perform that task and also review allegations of abuse and cover-up. They\u2019re also seeking a \u201csurvivor restoration fund\u201d and memorial dedicated to survivors.Momentum for change grew as survivors such as Jules Woodson, who went public in 2018 with a sexual assault accusation against her former youth pastor, were emboldened to tell their stories.\u201cI felt like, `Thank God there\u2019s a space where we can tell these stories,\u201d\u2019 Woodson said.Such accounts led to the independent investigation, whose 288-page report detailed how the SBC\u2019s Executive Committee prioritized protecting the institution over victims\u2019 well-being and preventing abuse.The committee has apologized and made public a long-secret list of ministers accused of abuse.Woodson said seeing her abuser\u2019s name on it felt like a double-edged sword.\u201cIt was in some ways validating that my abuser was on there, but it was also devastating to see that they knew and yet nobody in the SBC spoke up to warn others,\u201d she said.Woodson added that she is still waiting for meaningful change: \u201cThey have offered minimal words acknowledging the problem, but they have offered zero reform and true action which would show genuine repentance or care and concern for survivors or the vulnerable people who have yet to be abused.\u201d", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/church.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "June 12, 2022 "}, {"title": "Canada, U.S. face democratic \u2018rough patches\u2019 amid populism: American envoy", "description": "Canada and the United States are facing \u201crough patches\u201d in their democracies as populist, authoritarian movements continue to find traction among Western countries, says the American ambassador.But in an interview with The West Block\u2018s Mercedes Stephenson, David Cohen said he is ultimately optimistic that the democracies will find a way through the political turmoil of recent years.\u201cI am always a glass-half-full kind of a guy,\u201d Cohen said.\u00a0\u201cI irrevocably believe that democracy will prevail.\u201cWe may have to work through some issues.

It\u2019s not hard to find people, including Democrats in Congress, who accuse the oil companies of price gouging.As with many things in life, the answer is complicated.Gasoline prices have been surging since April 2020, when the initial shock of the pandemic drove prices under $1.80 a gallon, according to government figures. They hit $3 in May 2021 and cruised past $4 this March.On Saturday, the nationwide average for a gallon ticked just above $5, a record, according to auto club AAA, which has tracked prices for years. The average price jumped 18 cents in the previous week, and was $1.92 higher than this time last year.State averages ranged from $6.43 a gallon in California to $4.52 in Mississippi.Several factors are coming together to push gasoline prices higher.Global oil prices have been rising _ unevenly, but sharply overall _ since December. The price of international crude has roughly doubled in that time, with the U.S. benchmark rising nearly as much, closing Friday at more than $120 a barrel.Russia\u2019s invasion of Ukraine and the resulting sanctions by the United States and its allies have contributed to the rise. Russia is a leading oil producer.The United States is the world\u2019s largest oil producer, but U.S. capacity to turn oil into gasoline is down 900,000 barrels of oil per day since the end of 2019, according to the Energy Department.Tighter oil and gasoline supplies are hitting as energy consumption rises because of the economic recovery.Finally, Americans typically drive more starting around Memorial Day, adding to the demand for gasoline.Analysts say there are no quick fixes; it\u2019s a matter of supply and demand, and supply can\u2019t be ramped up overnight.If anything, the global oil supply will grow tighter as sanctions against Russia take hold. European Union leaders have vowed to ban most Russian oil by the end of this year.The U.S. has already imposed a ban even as Biden acknowledged it would affect American consumers. He said the ban was necessary so that the U.S. does not subsidize Russia\u2019s war in Ukraine. \u201cDefending freedom is going to cost,\u201d he declared.The U.S. could ask Saudi Arabia, Venezuela or Iran to help pick up the slack for the expected drop in Russian oil production, but each of those options carries its own moral and political calculations.Republicans have called on Biden to help increase domestic oil production _ for example, by allowing drilling on more federal lands and offshore, or reversing his decision to revoke a permit for a pipeline that could carry Canadian oil to Gulf Coast refineries.However, many Democrats and environmentalists would howl if Biden took those steps, which they say would undercut efforts to limit climate change. Even if Biden ignored a big faction of his own party, it would be months or years before those measures could lead to more gasoline at U.S. service stations.At the end of March, Biden announced another tapping of the nation\u2019s Strategic Petroleum Reserve to bring down gasoline prices. The average price per gallon has jumped 77 cents since then, which analysts say is partly because of a refining squeeze.Some refineries that produce gasoline, jet fuel, diesel and other petroleum products shut down during the first year of the pandemic, when demand collapsed. While a few are expected to boost capacity in the next year or so, others are reluctant to invest in new facilities because the transition to electric vehicles will reduce demand for gasoline over the long run.The owner of one of the nation\u2019s largest refineries, in Houston, announced in April that it will close the facility by the end of next year.Higher energy prices hit lower-income families the hardest. Workers in retail and the fast-food industry can\u2019t work from home _ they must commute by car or public transportation.The National Energy Assistance Directors Association estimates that the 20% of families with the lowest income could be spending 38% of their income on energy including gasoline this year, up from 27% in 2020.It could be up to motorists themselves _ by driving less, they would reduce demand and put downward pressure on prices.\u201cThere has got to be some point where people start cutting back, I just don\u2019t know what the magic point is,\u201d said Patrick De Haan, an analyst for the gas-shopping app GasBuddy. \u201cIs it going to be $5? Is it going to be $6, or $7? That\u2019s the million-dollar question that nobody knows.\u201dOn Saturday morning at a BP station in Brooklyn, New York, computer worker Nick Schaffzin blamed Putin for the $5.45 per gallon he was shelling out and said he will make sacrifices to pay the price.\u201cYou just cut back on some other things _ vacations, discretionary stuff, stuff that\u2019s nice to have but you don\u2019t need,\u201d he said. \u201cGas you need.\u201dAt the same station, George Chen said he will have to raise the prices he charges his customers for film production to cover the gas he burns driving around New York City. He acknowledged that others aren\u2019t so fortunate.\u201cIt\u2019s going to be painful for people who don\u2019t get pay increases right away,\u201d he said. \u201dI can only imagine the families who can\u2019t afford it.\u201d", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/gas-prices-gas-pump.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "June 12, 2022 "}, {"title": "China accuses U.S. of bullying, turning Asian countries against China", "description": "China\u2019s defense minister accused the United States on Sunday of trying to \u201chijack\u201d the support of countries in the Asia-Pacific region to turn them against Beijing, saying Washington is seeking to advance its own interests \u201cunder the guise of multilateralism.\u201dDefense Minister Gen. Wei Fenghe lashed out at U.S. Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, rejecting his \u201csmearing accusation\u201d the day before at the Shangri-La Dialogue that China was causing instability with its claim to the self-governing island of Taiwan and its increased military activity in the area.Austin had stressed the need for multilateral partnerships with nations in the Indo-Pacific, which Wei suggested was an attempt to back China into a corner.\u201cNo country should impose its will on others or bully others under the guise of multilateralism,\u201d he said. \u201cThe strategy is an attempt to build an exclusive small group in the name of a free and open Indo-Pacific to hijack countries in our region and target one specific country\u2014 it is a strategy to create conflict and confrontation to contain and encircle others.\u201dChina has been rapidly modernizing its military and seeking to expand its influence and ambitions in the region, recently signing a security agreement with the Solomon Islands that many fear could lead to a Chinese naval base in the Pacific, and breaking ground this past week on a naval port expansion project in Cambodia that could give Beijing a foothold in the Gulf of Thailand.Last year U.S. officials accused China of testing a hypersonic missile, a weapon harder for missile defense systems to counter, but China insisted it had been a \u201croutine test of a spacecraft.\u201dAnswering a question about the test on Sunday, Wei came the closest so far to acknowledging it was, indeed, a hypersonic missile, saying, \u201cAs for hypersonic weapons, many countries are developing weapons and I think there\u2019s no surprise that China is doing so.\u201d\u201cChina will develop its military,\u201d he added. \u201cI think it\u2019s natural.\u201dU.S. Secretary of State Antony Blinken last month said China represented the \u201cmost serious long-term challenge to the international order\u201d for the United States, with its claims to Taiwan and efforts to dominate the strategic South China Sea.The U.S. and its allies have responded with so-called freedom of navigation patrols in the South China Sea and Taiwan Strait, sometimes encountering a pushback from China\u2019s military.Wei accused the U.S. of \u201cmeddling in the affairs of our region\u201d with the patrols, and \u201cflexing the muscles by sending warships and warplanes on a rampage in the South China Sea.\u201dChina has squared off with the Philippines and Vietnam, among others, over maritime claims and Wei said it was up to the countries in the region to find their own solutions.\u201cChina calls for turning the South China Sea into a sea of peace, friendship and cooperation,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the shared wish and responsibility of countries in the region.\u201dTaiwan and China split during a civil war in 1949, but China claims the island as its own territory, and has not ruled out the use of military force to take it, while maintaining it is a domestic political issue.Washington follows a \u201cone-China\u201d policy, which recognizes Beijing but allows informal relations and defense ties with Taipei. It provides arms to Taiwan and follows a \u201cstrategic ambiguity\u201d approach about how far it would be willing to go to defend Taiwan in the face of a Chinese invasion. At the same time, it does not support Taiwanese independence.President Joe Biden raised eyebrows and China\u2019s pique last month saying that the U.S. would intervene militarily if Taiwan were attacked, though the White House later said the comments did not reflect a policy shift.Austin on Saturday accused China of threatening to change the status quo on Taiwan with a \u201csteady increase in provocative and destabilizing military activity\u201d near the island.Wei fired back Sunday that the U.S. was not adhering to its \u201cone-China\u201d policy, saying \u201cit keeps playing the Taiwan card against China.\u201dHe said China\u2019s \u201cgreatest wish\u201d was \u201cpeaceful reunification\u201d with Taiwan, but also made clear Beijing was willing to do whatever it took to realize its goals.\u201cChina will definitely realize its reunification,\u201d he said. \u201cChina\u2019s reunification is a great cause of the Chinese nation, and it is a historical trend that no one and no force can stop.\u201dHe added that China would \u201cresolutely crush any attempt to pursue Taiwan independence.\u201d\u201cWe will not hesitate to fight, we will fight at all costs and we will fight to the very end,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is the only choice for China.\u201dWei and Austin met one-on-one on Saturday, and Taiwan featured prominently in their discussions, according to the U.S.On Sunday, Wei met with Australian Defense Minister Richard Marles, which the Australian Broadcasting Corp. reported was the first high-level meeting between the two countries in more than two years.Marles said it had been three years since Chinese and Australian defense ministers had met, and called the meeting a \u201ccritical first step.\u201d\u201cAs Sec. Austin observed after his own meeting with Defense Minister Wei, it is really important in these times to have open lines of dialogue,\u201d he told reporters.\u201cAustralia and China\u2019s relationship is complex and it\u2019s precisely because of this complexity that it is really important that we are engaging in dialogue right now.\u201d", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/xyt101-62_2019_010417-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "June 12, 2022 "}]
