William is the only monarchy member to hold a positive majority of those favourable among Canadians six months after Charles ascended to the throne. The Prince and Princess of Wales\u2019 favourability is highest among the university-educated, Ipsos found.As for the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Harry and Megan, both have dropped in approval since the queen\u2019s death. Down nine points, 47 per cent view Harry favourably, which is also the case for Meghan, who is down six points at 44 per cent.\u201cIf the monarchy can get through Charles, it\u2019s probably in a better shape from a public opinion standpoint under presumably what would be king William,\u201d Simpson said.King Charles\u2019 low approval ratings appear to be a factor when it comes to Canadians\u2019 interest in his coronation May 6, the poll shows.Twenty-eight per cent of Canadians said they will watch the ceremony, with interest higher among those aged 55 or older. The same proportion said they will either listen to or read news about it.Seventeen per cent say they will probably talk about it with friends or family, while 11 per cent were likely to read up on the history of the monarchy. Seven per cent said they will post on social media about the event, which is higher among those aged 18 to 34.Only six per cent said they will buy a commemorative souvenir, while three per cent would hold a party to celebrate the ceremony; three per cent said they would travel to London to see it.At the end of the day, 45 per cent said they won\u2019t be paying attention, and aren\u2019t likely to do any of the above. That sentiment was higher among Quebec residents, with 59 per cent indicating such \u2014 14 points higher when compared to the national average.\u201cWe\u2019re seeing anti-monarchist sentiment increasing at 53 per cent favouring to sever ties,\u201d Simpson said.\u201cThat\u2019s likely not yet a critical mass in Canada, particularly because Quebecers are far more likely than those in English Canada to say that they would support abolishing ties to the monarchy.\u201dCanadians\u2019 appreciation of the monarchy\u2019s role and relevance has also faded since the queen\u2019s death, the poll suggests.Sixty per cent of Canadians feel Prime Minister Justin Trudeau should hold a referendum on its future in Canada; 58 per cent feel Canada is not truly an independent nation with ties to the Crown and 61 per cent feel the monarchy\u2019s history with colonialism and slavery doesn\u2019t have a place within Canadian society.\u201cConstitutional change in this country requires a pretty high threshold of support, and we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d Simpson said.\u201cBut if the trend continues, if King Charles and the Prince of Wales and family can\u2019t turn the tide around, there\u2019s a potential that maybe \u2026 we will have reached that critical mass.\u201dSimpson noted that Ipsos, which has logged data from multiple polls on the monarchy\u00a0stretching over 20 years, found Queen Elizabeth II enjoyed consistent support since 2002, being viewed favourably by more than 80 per cent of Canadians.Sentiment swayed from time to time, most notably after Princess Diana\u2019s death in 1997, but roughly remained positive when compared to now, he noted.Regardless, King Charles\u2019 reign will likely be defined by change, Simpson added.\u201cQueen Elizabeth II was a staunch supporter of tradition, and many things she didn\u2019t want to change or when she did change, it was reluctantly done. King Charles III has already signalled that he\u2019s going to change. He\u2019s more active in some areas, like the environment,\u201d he said.\u201cHis reign, obviously given his age, will be more limited in duration, so I don\u2019t think aside from an attempt to modernize (that) we\u2019re going to see a lot of things that are radically different \u2014 more of a placeholder until such time as the current Prince of Wales \u2026 takes over and has a longer reign.\u201dThese are some of the findings of an Ipsos poll conducted between April 19 and 20, 2023, on behalf of Global News. For this survey, a sample of 1,000 Canadians aged 18+ was interviewed. Quotas and weighting were employed to ensure that the sample\u2019s composition reflects that of the Canadian population according to census parameters. The precision of Ipsos online polls is measured using a credibility interval. In this case, the poll is accurate to within \u00b1 3.5 percentage points, 19 times out of 20, had all Canadians aged 18+ been polled. The credibility interval will be wider among subsets of the population.

The RIA news agency said he had not been in the Kremlin at the time, and was working on Wednesday at his Novo Ogaryovo residence outside Moscow.\u201cThe Russian side reserves the right to take retaliatory measures where and when it sees fit,\u201d the Kremlin added.Former Russian president Dmitry Medvedev, now deputy head of Russia\u2019s Security Council, said the incident \u201cleaves us no option but to physically eliminate Zelenskyy and his clique.\u201dTwo of\u00a0numerous videos\u00a0published on Russian social media channels show two objects flying on the same trajectory toward one of the highest points in the Kremlin complex, the dome of the Senate. The first seemed to be destroyed with little more than a puff of smoke, the second appeared to leave blazing wreckage on the dome.Reuters checks on time and location indicated that the videos could be authentic, though some Western analysts said it was possible Russia might have staged the incident to pin the blame on Kyiv and justify some kind of crushing response.Ukrainian presidential adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said the drone accusation, along with an announcement that Russia had caught suspected saboteurs in Ukraine\u2019s Russian-occupied Crimea region, \u201cclearly indicates the preparation of a large scale terrorist provocation by Russia in the coming days.\u201dIn Washington, the White House said it was aware of reports that Russia had accused Ukraine of attacking the Kremlin with drones to try to kill Putin but could not authenticate the allegations.Russia says it launched its \u201cspecial military operation\u201d to counter a threat from Kyiv\u2019s relations with the West. Ukraine and its allies call it an unprovoked war of conquest by Moscow, derailed by a failed assault on the capital Kyiv early last year and Ukrainian advances in the second half of 2022.Over the past five months, Ukrainian ground forces have kept mostly to the defensive, while Russia launched a huge, largely unsuccessful winter assault, capturing little new ground.In Ukraine\u2019s southern Kherson region on Wednesday, 18 civilians were killed and 46 injured in heavy Russian shelling that hit a hypermarket, a railway station and residential buildings, Ukrainian officials said.At least 12 of those killed were in Kherson city, which has been repeatedly shelled from areas of Kherson province occupied by Russia. The dead included three engineers trying to repair damage to the power grid from earlier Russian bombardments.\u201cWhen the enemy can achieve nothing on the battlefield, it strikes at peaceful cities,\u201d Ukrainian military spokesperson Serhii Cherevatyi said.Elsewhere, oil depots were ablaze in southern Russia and Ukraine alike as both sides escalated a drone war ahead of Kyiv\u2019s promised spring counteroffensive against Russian forces.Ukraine said it had shot down 21 of 26 Iranian-made drones in an overnight volley.Ukraine and Russia have both been carrying out long-range strikes since last week in apparent anticipation of a Ukrainian counteroffensive, which Zelenskyy said would begin soon, aided by supplies of sophisticated Western weaponry.Moscow says it has struck military targets, though it has produced no evidence to support this. Kyiv, without confirming any role in incidents in Russia or Crimea, says destroying infrastructure is preparation for its planned ground assault.Zelenskyy visited Finland on Wednesday, his fourth known trip abroad since Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion. Leaders of Denmark, Iceland, Norway and Sweden also attended his visit.Zelenskyy said his goals were to beef up Ukraine\u2019s military and secure an eventual place in the NATO alliance, a goal endorsed by the five Nordic nations in a statement.Blinken said later the U.S. government had authorized another $300 million worth of arms and equipment for Ukraine.", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/20230325140356-641f44aeb853773905e82b1fjpeg-2.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "May 3, 2023 "}, {"title": "Astronaut Jeremy Hansen to carry Canada\u2019s flag at King Charles coronation", "description": "Before astronaut Jeremy Hansen gets a chance to wear Canada\u2019s colours on a flight around the moon next year, he will carry the Canadian flag at the coronation of the country\u2019s new King.The Prime Minister\u2019s Office released a list of dignitaries and eminent Canadians who will join Justin Trudeau and Gov.

Sajjan added he hopes to visit Chad and speak with officials from the African Union, which is based in Ethiopia.By that point, he said it should be clearer which countries have ended up hosting people who are displaced and trying to find safety.\u201cOnce we have that assessment and the UN comes up with their appeal, we\u2019ll put in additional funding,\u201d he said.Sajjan said the funding is flexibly structured so groups can scale up existing programs to meet huge flows of people fleeing a devastating escalation in violence that started in Sudan on April 15.A battle for control of the country erupted after months of escalating tensions between the military and a rival paramilitary group called the Rapid Support Forces, turning the capital of Khartoum into a war zone and leading western countries to evacuate their citizens.Defence Minister Anita Anand said Wednesday that Canada had given up on trying to use a military airport in Khartoum for evacuation flights because of logistical and safety issues. Instead, the military is focusing on helping people who make the perilous journey to Sudan\u2019s coastline.\u201cWe still have two ships off the coast of Sudan and we\u2019re working very closely with Global Affairs Canada and with our allies to ensure the safety and security of all Canadians,\u201d she told reporters.The UN\u2019s humanitarian chief, Martin Griffiths, arrived in the country Wednesday where he said he is seeking guarantees from the warring sides for the safe passage of humanitarian aid. He noted criticism that the UN has been slow to respond, with its agencies saying they have scant funding and limited staff.Even before the fighting erupted last month, one-third of the population in Sudan relied on humanitarian assistance.Both sides have entered into another ceasefire, which, like previous agreements, has not actually quelled the fighting.Sajjan said it was \u201cdisturbing\u201d how quickly the conflict unfolded after Canada\u2019s work with allies to try bringing about peace in the region in recent years. He said large groups of desperate people bring on not only hunger and suffering, but also political instability that can create more crises.\u201cIt\u2019s important to put it into context for Canadians what the reality is on the ground, and why this funding is so important.\u201dHe noted that the UN only gets a fraction of the funding it needs to safely house people who have fled violence. The organization said it has just 15 per cent of the money it needs to support people in Chad. \u201cCanada does step up for our portion,\u201d Sajjan insisted.The conflict has so far killed 550 people, including civilians, and wounded more than 4,900. The fighting has displaced at least 334,000 people inside Sudan, and sent tens of thousands more to neighbouring countries _ Egypt, Chad, South Sudan, the Central African Republic and Ethiopia, according to UN agencies.Diversity Minister Ahmed Hussen noted that Sudan hosted a large number of refugees from other countries who now have to flee to a third country just to be safe.Among the recipients of Wednesday\u2019s cash is Save The Children Canada, whose humanitarian head Dalia Al-Awqati said the money is needed to address a \u201ccritical\u201d situation\u201cWith the conflict bringing Khartoum to a stop, the limited supply of food and essentials is driving up prices for available commodities to two, three or four times their market value,\u201d she wrote in an statement.Al-Awqati said Ottawa should boost its funding and continue its diplomatic efforts to help African leaders broker a solution and push for humanitarian access.\u201cCanada is well-positioned to have a holistic response to this crisis.\u201dSajjan\u2019s parliamentary secretary, Anita Vandenbeld, said the aid workers whom Canada is funding are not just helping people but providing key information on how Ottawa can best respond. She noted three World Food Programme workers were killed last month in Darfur.\u201cThese are the aid workers who are the last out and the first back in. They put themselves in the front line because they care deeply, and they have strong knowledge and partnerships on the ground,\u201d she said.Vandenbeld and her colleagues stressed that women will be key to finding a lasting resolution to the crisis, including women Canada has trained to act as peace negotiators.\u201cWe can\u2019t just look at women as victims. We have to look at them as the leaders and the solutions that come from the women\u2019s organizations who are very strong in the region.\u201d", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Sudan-Canada-aid-e1683145856451.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "May 3, 2023 "}, {"title": "Serbia school shooting suspect had list of targets in attack that killed 9: police", "description": "A boy gunned down fellow pupils in a Belgrade school on Wednesday morning in a pre-planned attack, shooting dead eight plus a security guard and wounding seven others, Serbian officials said.Using two handguns that belonged to his father,\u00a0the 13-year-old\u00a0fired first at the guard and three girls in the hallway and then entered a history class and shot the teacher and classmates, police said. The teacher and six pupils were hospitalized, some with life-threatening injuries.Veselin Milic, head of Belgrade police, said the attacker had two guns and two petrol bombs and had planned everything carefully. \u201cHe even had \u2026 names of children he wanted to kill and their classes,\u201d he told a press conference.While Milic said the shooter planned the attack for a month, sketching classrooms and writing out a list of children he planned to \u201cliquidate,\u201d authorities said they did not know the motive for shooting. It was unclear if he shot any of the people that he named on his list.Police said a seventh-grade student had been arrested after confessing to the shooting. An investigation into the motives for the attack was under way, they said, as Education Minister Branko Ruzic declared three days of national mourning.Interior Minister Bratislav Gasic said the suspect\u2019s father, who held the guns legally,\u00a0had also been arrested.Serbia\u2019s prosecution service said in a statement to the Tanjug news agency that the father would be charged over the shooting but not his son, who was 13, putting him below the legal age of criminal responsibility, which is 14 in Serbia.Gun ownership is\u00a0widespread\u00a0in Serbia, which has witnessed several mass shootings over the past decade and where hundreds of thousands of weapons remain unaccounted for after the Balkan wars of the 1990s.Wednesday\u2019s shooting happened at Vladislav Ribnikar, an elementary school in Vracar, a central Belgrade district.Evgenija, 14, said she knew the suspected gunman.\u201cHe was somehow silent, and appeared nice and had good grades. Did not know much about him, he was not that open to everyone. I would never expect that this could happen,\u201d she told Reuters.\u201cI heard noises and I thought some boys, some kids were throwing firecrackers\u2026. But then I saw the security guard falling to the ground,\u201d she said, adding that she then ran away.The interior ministry said eight children and a security guard had been killed and six children had been hospitalized along with the teacher.Sarah el Sarag, a lawyer who lives locally and is due to send her second child to the school in September, described the dead security guard as gentle and peaceful.\u201cHe was great guy, \u2026a man who loved the kids. I don\u2019t know what was in the head of that child who shot him,\u201d she told Reuters.Health Minister Danica Grujicic, a neurosurgeon who witnessed the impact of the Balkan wars, told reporters in tears that Wednesday\u2019s events were \u201cperhaps the most horrifying experience I have had as a doctor and as a human being.\u201dThe head of Belgrade\u2019s University Hospital, Milika Asanin, said it was treating three pupils and the teacher.\u201cOne patient\u00a0\u2026\u00a0had chest injury and a neck injury. One pupil was shot in the left leg, one in the stomach and both arms. The teacher has a stomach injury,\u201d he said.Milan Milosevic said his daughter was in the classroom when the attacker burst in.\u201cShe managed to escape. (The boy) \u2026 first shot the teacher and then he started shooting randomly,\u201d Milosevic, who had rushed to the school, told broadcaster N1.\u201cI saw the security guard lying under the table. I saw two girls with blood on their shirts.\u201dVracar mayor Milan Nedeljkovic said doctors were fighting to save the teacher\u2019s life while Sinisa Ducic, acting director of a Belgrade pediatric clinic also treating three of the children, said one pupil underwent surgery on her head.Gun laws are very strict in Serbia but civilian gun ownership is also widespread.According to the 2018 Small Arms Survey, Serbia globally ranked third with 39.1 firearms per 100 people, and more than 78,000 people have hunting licenses.The survey estimate includes many weapons held illegally since the wars and unrest of the 1990s, despite authorities having issued several amnesties for owners to hand in or register illicit guns.In the deadliest shooting in Serbia since then, Ljubisa Bogdanovic killed 14 people in 2013. Other\u00a0mass shootings\u00a0occurred in 2007, 2015 and 2016. All the assailants were adults.Luka 17, a student at the high school next to Vladislav Ribnikar, said Wednesday\u2019s tragedy had been long in the making.\u201cThis is a mistake that the entire Serbian society is making for over a decade \u2026this popularization of violent crime through public and media, through art, through everything,\u201d he said.\u2014 Reporting by Aleksandar Vasovic and Ivana Sekularac; additional reporting by Anna Magdalena Lubowicka; writing by John Stonestreet and Philippa Fletcher; editing by Philippa Fletcher and Aleksandar Vasovic.

The Globe also reported a Chinese diplomat who remains in Canada was allegedly involved.\u201cWe\u2019re making it very clear to CSIS and our intelligence officials that when there are concerns that talk specifically about any MP \u2013 particularly about their family \u2013 those need to be elevated even if CSIS doesn\u2019t feel that it\u2019s a sufficient level of concern for them to take more direct action,\u201d Trudeau said.\u201cWe still need to know about it at the upper government levels.\u201dTrudeau said he only learned of the development on Monday after it was reported that CSIS had intelligence about the threats concerning Chong\u2019s family two years ago.He said CSIS was asked to brief Chong at the time after China publicly said it would sanction him for criticizing Beijing\u2019s treatment of Uyghur Muslims in China\u2019s Xinjiang province. CSIS never told anybody else about the information it had, Trudeau said.In February 2021, Chong voted in favour of a motion condemning China\u2019s treatment of its Uyghur minority as a genocide. The following month, China sanctioned Chong, barring him from entering the county and prohibiting Chinese citizens from conducting business with him.Trudeau said that when it comes to the safety and security of MPs or their families, intelligence agencies should always make that information known.\u201cIf anyone ever puts a threat against an MP or a family, we need to know about it and we\u2019re going to make sure that CSIS elevates that, even if it\u2019s not a credible threat or doesn\u2019t hit the threshold that they would decide is necessary,\u201d he said.\u201cWhen it comes to MPs and their families, I think we have to have a lower threshold.\u201dChong told reporters Wednesday that while he was briefed by CSIS officials at the time, it was \u201cgeneral in nature\u201d and did not include specific threats regarding him or his family abroad.Chong then took aim at the Trudeau government for not removing the Chinese diplomat from Canada.\u201cThey didn\u2019t tell me about this particular individual \u2026 and they didn\u2019t expel this particular individual,\u201d he said.\u201cThe government needs to come clean about who knew what and when, and what they did about it.\u201dConservative Leader Pierre Poilievre has urged Trudeau to expel the diplomat in question and accused Trudeau of failing to take proper action, including delivering a warning to Chong.Poilievre also said the alleged threats were reason for Canada to create a foreign agent registry as soon as possible that would keep track of people being paid to act on behalf of foreign countries in Canada.The government launched public consultations on that idea in March, and they are expected to wrap up next week.\u2014 with files from The Canadian Press", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Trudeau-foreign-interference.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "May 3, 2023 "}, {"title": "Australia\u2019s near-ban on vaping targets \u2018widespread\u2019 use in schools", "description": "Australia said on Tuesday it will ban recreational vaping and tighten other aspects of e-cigarette laws in the biggest crackdown on the tobacco industry in more than a decade to try to stop an alarming rise in teenage vaping.The government aims to ban all disposable vapes, which often comes in fruity flavours, ban the import of non-prescription vapes and limit nicotine levels, aiming for the sale of vapes to be confined to helping smokers quit.\u201cJust like they did with smoking, Big Tobacco has taken another addictive product, wrapped it in shiny packaging and added flavours to create a new generation of nicotine addicts,\u201d Health Minister Mark Butler said in a speech at the National Press Club.Vaping, widely seen as a safer alternative to smoking cigarettes and useful for helping smokers quit, involves heating a liquid that contains nicotine in what is called an e-cigarette and turning it into a vapour that users inhale.But\u00a0studies\u00a0have shown the potential of long-term harm from the addictive e-cigarettes.Under the new rules,\u00a0vapes will be sold only in pharmacies and require \u201cpharmaceutical-type\u201d packaging. Disposable\u00a0vapes popular with young people will also be banned.Though a prescription is needed to buy nicotine\u00a0vapes in Australia, lax border enforcement and a thriving illegal market mean they are readily available in convenience stores and other outlets.Major\u00a0vape\u00a0manufacturer Philip Morris\u00a0PM.N\u00a0welcomed the crackdown on such shops.\u201cNicotine vaping products sold in corner stores have always been illegal,\u201d a spokesperson for the company said.\u201cWe have been urging enforcement against these illegal products for several years and hope this will now happen.\u201dButler said vaping had become a recreational product in Australia, mostly sold to teenagers and young people, who are three times as likely to take up smoking.\u201cThis is a product targeted at our kids, sold alongside lollies and chocolate bars,\u201d Butler said. \u201cVaping has now become the number one behavioral issue in high schools. And it\u2019s becoming widespread in primary schools as well.\u201dCanada has also explored ways to tamp down on underage vaping. While it\u2019s illegal for teenagers to buy vapes,\u00a0a recent study suggests\u00a0over a quarter of Canadian high school students have vaped in the past month.Health Canada brought in nicotine restrictions for vaping products in 2021, and last year proposed regulations that could force vape product manufacturers to disclose information to the federal health agency on sales and ingredients.Last month Quebec tabled new regulations that would ban the sale of flavoured vaping products as well as colourful packaging.Isabelle Charest, the province\u2019s minister responsible for sports and recreation, said at the time that over 90 per cent of vapes used by minors are sweetened or flavoured.Similar bans are already in place in Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Prince Edward Island, the Northwest Territories and Nunavut, according to the Heart and Stroke Foundation.Doctors backed the vaping crackdown but urged the government to do more to limit the number of young people taking it up.\u201cNicotine vaping products are being sold featuring colorful flavours and we have even seen products featuring the same type of imagery as children\u2019s breakfast cereal including cartoon characters,\u201d said Nicole Higgins, president of the Royal Australian College of General Practitioners.About 22% of Australians aged 18-24 have used an e-cigarette or vaping device at least once, data last year showed.The federal budget, due out next week, will include A$234 million for measures to protect against the harm caused by tobacco and vaping.Australia has one of the toughest anti-smoking laws in the world.In 2012, it became the first country to force cigarette producers to abandon distinct, colourful branding and sell their products in uniformly drab packets.Tobacco firms were quick to switch to e-cigarettes that offer different flavours and created designs targeting a new generation of users.Butler said the government had no plan to follow neighboring New Zealand in banning cigarette sales for\u00a0future generations but said the tax on tobacco would be raised by 5 per cent a year over the next three years in a bid to curb sales.Some countries\u00a0have tried to restrict vaping and some see it as a good way to get smokers to kick the habit.Britain said in April up to one million smokers would be encouraged to\u00a0swap cigarettes for\u00a0vapes, in what was a world first, offering financial incentives for pregnant women and providing e-cigarette starter kits to help.\u2014 Reporting by Renju Jose in Sydney; Editing by Sonali Paul, Robert Birsel.

They include random violent incidents in public areas, such as knife and vehicle attacks as well as explosions,\u201d officials said in a May 2 travel advisory.\u201cThese incidents have occurred mainly in the London area but have also happened elsewhere. Further attacks in the United Kingdom are likely.\u201dThe coronation will take place at Westminster Abbey in London, with processions planned between Buckingham Palace and the abbey before and after the ceremony.Large crowds are expected in the days before and after the event, including in the area of the High Commission of Canada, the government said. They can lead to disruptions to traffic and public transportation. Accommodations may be limited.Terrorists have used occasions like public celebrations to mount attacks, Ottawa said. Targets could include government buildings, schools, places of worship, airports and other tourist attractions, like restaurants, bars, coffee shops, markets and hotels.Most recently in 2019, a man previously convicted of terrorism offences stabbed two people to death and injured three others before being shot dead by police on London Bridge. In 2017, 30 people were injured after a homemade explosive device was partially detonated inside a crowded subway station.\u201cAlways be aware of your surroundings when in public places,\u201d the government said.

When he was refused, he began to throw shotgun cartridges into the palace grounds, the force said.Deputy Assistant Commissioner Ade Adelekan said the man was searched and a lock knife was found. He was arrested on suspicion of possession of a knife and ammunition. Adelekan said the man\u2019s backpack was blown up in a controlled explosion after the suspect told officers to handle it with care.Police said the run-in was not being treated as terrorism-related. No shots were fired, and no one was injured. Charles and Camilla, the queen consort, were not at Buckingham Palace at the time.More than 9,000 police officers will be on coronation day duty in London. Tugendhat said the presence of so many foreign dignitaries \u2013 and potentially myriad protesters \u2013 made it \u201ca very complex policing operation, a very complex intelligence operation.\u201dHundreds of anti-monarchist protesters plan to chant \u201cNot my king\u201d during the procession, and police have said environmental activists could also try to disrupt the ceremonies. Activists accused authorities of trying to intimidate protesters with a government letter reminding them of new police powers to curb disruptive demonstrations.The new measures in the Public Order Act, introduced in response to civil disobedience by environmental groups, allow police to search demonstrators for items including locks and glue, and impose penalties of up to 12 months in prison for protesters who block roads or interfere with \u201cnational infrastructure.\u201dGraham Smith of anti-monarchist group Republic described the letter as \u201cintimidatory.\u201d He said the group would protest as planned on coronation day.\u2014 with files from The Associated Press", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/Coronation-security.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "May 3, 2023 "}, {"title": "Russia will keep talking with UN over Black Sea grain deal, Kremlin says", "description": "The Kremlin said on Wednesday that Russia\u00a0would\u00a0continue talks with the United Nations and other parties to the Black Sea grain deal, and that\u00a0Moscow\u00a0would not do anything to harm its own interests.On a call with reporters, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: \u201cThe Russian side will continue contacts with both UN and other representatives, in the hope that the terms of the deal will be fulfilled after all.\u201dHe added: \u201cOf course, Russia will not do anything further that will be contrary to its interests.\u201dRussia complains that its own food and fertilizer exports are still facing significant obstacles.

A broader disaster could be in the making as Sudan\u2019s impoverished neighbors grapple with the influx of refugees.Previous ceasefire agreements between the army and a paramilitary force, whose power struggle\u00a0erupted\u00a0into full blown conflict in mid-April, have ranged from 24 to 72 hours, but none have been fully observed.Tens of thousands of people, like Omdurman resident Salma, have left Khartoum area and its adjoining cities, fearful of both airstrikes and soldiers from the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF).She says she can hardly sleep at night.South Sudan\u2019s foreign ministry said on Tuesday that mediation championed by its president, Salva Kiir, had led both sides to agree a weeklong truce from Thursday to May 11 and to name envoys for peace talks. The current ceasefire was due to expire on Wednesday.It was unclear, however, how army chief General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan and paramilitary RSF leader General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo would proceed.Army jets have been bombing RSF units dug into residential districts of the capital region.Conflict has also spread to Sudan\u2019s western Darfur region where the RSF emerged from tribal militias that fought alongside government forces to crush rebels in a brutal civil war dating back 20 years.The commanders of the army and RSF, who had shared power as part of an internationally backed transition towards free elections and civilian government, have shown no sign of backing down, yet neither side seems able to secure a quick victory.Fighting now in its third week has engulfed Khartoum \u2013 one of Africa\u2019s largest cities \u2013 and killed hundreds of people.
