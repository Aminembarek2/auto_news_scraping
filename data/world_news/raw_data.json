Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is blocking the membership bids as he accuses the Nordic nations of supporting Kurdish militants deemed by Turkey to be terrorists.\u201cMy aim is to solve this issue as soon as possible, but since we are several nations involved in this process, there is no way to tell you exactly when we will solve it,\u201d Stoltenberg said.Because of Turkey\u2019s concerns, \u201cthis will take some more time than we originally expected,\u201d he said.U.K. Defence Secretary Ben Wallace said at a meeting Wednesday in Oslo that the ambition for the NATO summit in Madrid is ensuring \u201cthat Sweden and Finland are successfully on the next step towards accession into NATO.\u201d\u201cI think it is very important we listen and understand Turkey\u2019s concerns and work to a position where Turkey will support the accession and indeed that we can mitigate any of those concerns,\u201d Wallace said.", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/nato-ukraine-june-15.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720", "time": "June 15, 2022 "}, {"title": "WHO creates monkeypox vaccine-sharing program amid inequity fears", "description": "The World Health Organization said it\u2019s creating a new vaccine-sharing mechanism to stop the outbreak of monkeypox in more than 30 countries beyond Africa. The move could result in the UN health agency distributing scarce vaccine doses to rich countries that can otherwise afford them.To some health experts, the initiative potentially misses the opportunity to control monkeypox virus in the African countries where it\u2019s infected people for decades, serving as another example of the inequity in vaccine distribution that was seen during the coronavirus pandemic.WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said the agency is developing an initiative for \u201cfair access\u201d to vaccines and treatments that it hopes will be ready within weeks. The mechanism was proposed shortly after Britain, Canada, France, Germany, the U.S. and other countries reported hundreds of monkeypox cases last month.WHO has described the outbreak as \u201cunusual\u201d and said the virus\u2019 continuing spread was worrying enough to convene its expert committee next week to decide if monkeypox should be declared a global emergency.Vaccines for smallpox, a related disease, are thought to be about 85% effective against monkeypox. WHO\u2019s Europe director, Dr. Hans Kluge, said Wednesday he was concerned by the scramble by some rich countries to buy more vaccines without talk of buying supplies for Africa.Kluge urged governments \u201cto approach monkeypox without repeating the mistakes of the pandemic.\u201d Still, he did not discount the possibility that countries like Britain, which currently has the biggest outbreak beyond Africa, might receive vaccines through WHO\u2019s mechanism.He said the program was being created for all countries and that vaccines would largely be dispensed based on their epidemiological needs.\u201cEurope remains the epicenter of this escalating outbreak, with 25 countries reporting more than 1,500 cases, or 85 per cent of the global total,\u201d Kluge noted.Some African experts questioned why the UN health agency has never proposed using vaccines in central and West Africa, where the disease is endemic.\u201cThe place to start any vaccination should be Africa and not elsewhere,\u201d Dr. Ahmed Ogwell, acting director of the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, said.He said the lack of any vaccines to counter monkeypox on the continent, where more than 1,500 suspected cases and 72 deaths have been reported this year, was a more critical concern than the clusters of mostly mild disease being reported in rich countries.\u201cThis is an extension of the inequity that we saw during COVID,\u201d said Dr. Ifeanyi Nsofor, director of policy and advocacy at Nigeria Health Watch. \u201cWe have had hundreds of monkeypox cases in Nigeria from 2017 until now and we\u2019re just dealing with it on our own,\u201d he said. \u201cNobody has discussed when there might be vaccines available for Africa.\u201dAfter the coronavirus pandemic exploded in 2020, global health agencies rushed to set up COVAX, a UN-backed effort to distribute COVID-19 vaccines. But rich countries bought up most of the world\u2019s supply, and the COVAX program missed multiple targets to share doses with the world\u2019s poor.To date, only about 17 per cent of people in poorer countries have received a single dose of coronavirus vaccine. Some experts fear the same thing could happen with monkeypox.\u201cJust like with COVID, there is no clear path for how poorer countries will be able to get vaccines,\u201d Brook Baker, a Northeastern University law professor who specializes in access to medicines, said.He warned that as WHO attempts to determine how many vaccine doses are available, rich countries that previously promised doses might not cooperate.\u201cRich countries will protect themselves while people in the global south die,\u201d Baker predicted.On Monday, advocacy group Public Citizen sent a letter to the White House, asking if the Biden administration would release the 20 million smallpox vaccines the U.S. pledged in 2004 for WHO\u2019s use in the event of an emergency, like a biological attack.Asked about the commitment, a senior U.S. official said the government was \u201cexploring all options\u201d to further their efforts to stop monkeypox within the U.S. and globally.The official said the U.S. had returned more than 200,000 doses of a smallpox vaccine to the manufacturer so they would be available to others. The official declined to say if the U.S. considers the current monkeypox outbreak an emergency that warrants the release of the 20 million pledged vaccines.Francois Balloux, an infectious diseases expert at University College London, said vaccination efforts in rich countries should prompt an overhaul of future monkeypox response strategies in Africa.\u201cIt really should be a priority to vaccinate people in Africa, where there is a nastier strain that has actually killed people,\u201d he said, adding that more monkeypox spillovers were likely in the future.\u201cWhatever vaccination happens in Europe, that is not going to solve the problem,\u201d Balloux said.", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/monkeypox-who-june-15-2.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "June 15, 2022 "}, {"title": "Reports of monkeypox in semen prompts WHO investigation", "description": "The World Health Organization (WHO) is looking into reports that the monkeypox virus is present in the semen of patients, exploring the possibility that the disease could be sexually transmitted, a WHO official said on Wednesday.However, the agency reiterated that virus is mainly transmitted via close interpersonal contact. Many of the monkeypox cases confirmed in the current outbreak largely centered in Europe are among sexual partners who have had such close contact.In recent days, scientists have detected viral DNA in the semen of a handful of monkeypox patients in Italy and Germany, including a lab-tested sample that suggested the virus found in the semen of a single patient was capable of infecting another person and replicating.The detection of viral DNA does not necessarily imply that monkeypox is a sexually transmitted disease, such as HIV/AIDS or syphilis, which are understood to be caused by pathogens that pass from one person to the next specifically in semen, vaginal secretions or other bodily fluids.Viral DNA from a range of different viruses, including the Zika virus, has been found in semen, but it is unclear whether the presence of genetic material increases the risk of sexual transmission.It is not known whether recent reports mean that the monkeypox virus can be sexually transmitted, Catherine Smallwood, monkeypox incident manager at WHO/Europe, said in a press briefing.\u201cThis may have been something that we were unaware of in this disease before,\u201d she said.\u201cWe really need to focus on the most frequent mode of transmission and we clearly see that to be associated with skin to skin contact.\u201dMore than 1,300 cases of the viral disease have been reported by about 30 countries, mostly in Europe, since early May. Most cases have been reported in men who have sex with men.The outbreak has triggered concern since the virus is rarely seen outside of Africa, where it is endemic, and the majority of cases are not related to travel to the continent.Scientists are trying to understand what is driving the current outbreak, its origins and whether anything about the virus has changed.", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/monkeypox-who-june-15.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "June 15, 2022 "}, {"title": "U.K. planning more Rwanda flights to deport migrants despite legal rulings", "description": "The British government vowed Wednesday to organize more flights to deport asylum-seekers to Rwanda, after a last-minute court judgment grounded the first plane due to take off under the contentious policy.Home Secretary Priti Patel said \u201dpreparation for the next flight begins now\u201d despite legal rulings that none of the migrants earmarked for deportation could be sent to the East African country.Under a deal signed in April between Britain and Rwanda, the U.K. government plans to send some migrants who arrive in the U.K. as stowaways or in small boats to Rwanda, where their asylum claims will be processed. If successful, they will stay in the African country, rather than returning to Britain.Prime Minister Boris Johnson\u2019s government says the plan is a legitimate way to protect lives and thwart the criminal gangs that send migrants on risky journeys across the English Channel.Human rights groups argue that the plan rides roughshod over the protections afforded to refugees under rules set up after World War II. They have called the idea unworkable, inhumane and a waste of money _ Britain paid Rwanda 120 million pounds ($150 million) up front for the deal.Critics include leaders of the Church of England and \u2013 according to British news reports \u2013 heir to the throne Prince Charles, who is due to visit Rwanda next week as representative of his mother Queen Elizabeth II.U.K. courts refused last week to ground the first flight, scheduled for Tuesday, but the number due to be aboard was whittled down by appeals and legal challenges. The European Court of Human Rights \u2013 an international tribunal supported by 46 countries including the U.K. \u2013 ruled late Tuesday that an Iraqi man due to be on the plane shouldn\u2019t fly, saying he faced \u201ca real risk of irreversible harm.\u201d That allowed the final few migrants on the plane to win reprieve.U.K. Cabinet minister Therese Coffey said the government was \u201csurprised and disappointed\u201d by the ruling.\u201cI think the public will be surprised at European judges overruling British judges,\u201d she told Sky News.Some lawmakers from the governing Conservative Party say Britain should withdraw from the Strasbourg-based European human rights court, which the U.K. helped to set up.The European court\u2019s judgment on Tuesday didn\u2019t overrule British decisions, which declined to ground the flight as a whole. The ECHR dealt with the cases of an individual due to be aboard.A full trial of the legality of the U.K. government plan is due to be heard in the British courts by the end of July.Human rights lawyer Frances Swaine, who represents one of the people due to be sent to Rwanda, urged the government to wait for that decision before organizing any more deportation flights.\u201cI would be sitting back and thinking was it worth it, either from a financial or a legal perspective, to organize one of these very expensive flights again when they\u2019ve been so unsuccessful this time around on legal grounds,\u201d she said.The British government says it welcomes refugees who come by approved immigration routes, but wants to put the criminal smuggling gangs who operate dangerous Channel crossings out of business.Migration and refugee groups point out that there are no approved legal routes for most people, with the exception of those fleeing Afghanistan and Ukraine. The U.K. receives fewer asylum applications than comparably sized European countries such as France and Germany.There are also concerns about the migrants\u2019 treatment in Rwanda, the most densely populated country in Africa. While Rwanda was the site of a genocide that killed hundreds of thousands of people in 1994, the country has built a reputation for stability and economic progress since then, the British government argues.Critics say that stability comes at the cost of political repression.More than 28,000 migrants entered the U.K. across the Channel last year, up from 8,500 in 2020, and about 10,000 have arrived so far this year. Dozens have died, including 27 people in November when a single boat capsized.Johnson, fighting for his political life amid concerns about his leadership and ethics, has promised to stop the criminal gangs behind the perilous journeys _ a \u201ctough on immigration\u201d message that plays well with the Conservative grassroots.Migration groups say the Rwanda plan is unlikely to deter desperate people making risky journeys to Britain. More than 440 people were brought ashore by in southern England from small boats on Tuesday, including a heavily pregnant woman and parents with children.", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/boris-johnson-e1655292044535.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=276", "time": "June 15, 2022 "}, {"title": "Microsoft to retire Internet Explorer after 27 years, push users to Edge browser", "description": "Internet Explorer is finally headed out to pasture.As of Wednesday, Microsoft will no longer support the once-dominant browser that legions of web surfers loved to hate _ and a few still claim to adore. The 27-year-old application now joins BlackBerry phones, dial-up modems and Palm Pilots in the dustbin of tech history.IE\u2019s demise was not a surprise. A year ago, Microsoft said that it was putting an end to Internet Explorer on June 15, 2022, pushing users to its Edge browser, which was launched in 2015.The company made clear then it was time to move on.\u201cNot only is Microsoft Edge a faster, more secure and more modern browsing experience than Internet Explorer, but it is also able to address a key concern: compatibility for older, legacy websites and applications,\u201d Sean Lyndersay, general manager of Microsoft Edge Enterprise, wrote in a May 2021 blog post.Users marked Explorer\u2019s passing on Twitter, with some referring to it as a \u201cbug-ridden, insecure POS\u201d or the \u201ctop browser for installing other browsers.\u201d For others it was a moment for 90?s nostalgia memes, while The Wall Street Journal quoted a 22-year-old who was sad to see IE go.Microsoft released the first version of Internet Explorer in 1995, the antediluvian era of web surfing dominated by the first widely popular browser, Netscape Navigator. Its launch signaled the beginning of the end of Navigator: Microsoft went on to tie IE and its ubiquitous Windows operating system together so tightly that many people simply used it by default instead of Navigator.The Justice Department sued Microsoft in 1997, saying it violated an earlier consent decree by requiring computer makers to use its browser as a condition of using Windows. It eventually agreed to settle the antitrust battle in 2002 over its use of its Windows monopoly to squash competitors. It also tangled with European regulators who said that tying Internet Explorer to Windows gave it an unfair advantage over rivals such as Mozilla\u2019s Firefox, Opera and Google\u2019s Chrome.Users, meanwhile, complained that IE was slow, prone to crashing and vulnerable to hacks. IE\u2019s market share, which in the early 2000s was over 90%, began to fade as users found more appealing alternatives.Today, the Chrome browser dominates with roughly a 65% share of the worldwide browser market, followed by Apple\u2019s Safari with 19%, according to internet analytics company Statcounter.

The committee has shown clips not only from the violent attack on the Capitol, but also from its own closed-door interviews with Trump aides and associates who were trying to dissuade him from spreading falsehoods about an election he lost.A rundown of what we\u2019ve learned so far from the public hearings of the select Jan. 6 committee \u2014 and what\u2019s next:One after one, video excerpts have been played of Trump\u2019s aides describing their conversations with the just-defeated president as returns came in on election night and in the days afterward, as it became increasingly obvious that he had lost to Democrat Joe Biden. The committee is trying to establish that Trump pushed lies about widespread election fraud despite hearing clear evidence that it didn\u2019t happen.As the aides tried to be realistic with the president, Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani took the opposite approach, telling him on election night that he should declare victory right away, according to the testimony. It was four more days until Biden was declared the winner.Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka Trump, said she knew it was clear that the results would not be final on election night. Campaign aide Jason Miller said a better sense of the numbers was needed before making any declarations. Campaign manager Bill Stepien said he advised Trump to tell reporters that the race was too early to call, that he was proud of the campaign he ran and that he was in a good position to win.But Trump didn\u2019t listen. Miller said that Trump told the room that anyone who didn\u2019t agree with Giuliani was being \u201cweak.\u201d He went out and publicly declared the election \u201ca fraud on the American public.\u201d\u201cFrankly, we did win this election,\u201d Trump said.In the weeks after the election, the Department of Justice investigated Trump\u2019s claims of widespread fraud. States and localities that had counted the votes did their own checks. None found evidence to support the claims that Trump and Giuliani were pushing.Attorney General Bill Barr, who resigned from office after publicly declaring there was no evidence of widespread fraud, described his interactions with the president as he tried to convince him of the facts. Not only was Trump angry, but he was becoming \u201cdetached from reality,\u201d Barr said in a videotaped deposition.Barr said that when he would tell Trump \u201chow crazy some of these allegations were, there was never, there was never an indication of interest in what the actual facts were.\u201dTwo in-person witnesses at the committee\u2019s hearing on Monday talked about Trump and Giuliani\u2019s pressure to try and overturn the results in their states. BJay Pak, a former U.S. attorney in Atlanta who resigned as Trump pressured Georgia officials, said his office investigated Giuliani\u2019s \u201creckless\u201d claims about fraud in the state and found them to be \u201csimply untrue.\u201dPhiladelphia City Commissioner Al Schmidt, the only Republican on the city\u2019s election board, said Trump\u2019s claims about fraud in his city were \u201cfantastical\u201d and thorough investigations turned up nothing of the sort.The panel detailed Trump\u2019s fundraising off his own falsehoods. He and his allies raised hundreds of millions after the election, the committee said, and broadly misled donors as to where some of the money was going. Some of the dollars that were advertised as going to an \u201celection defense fund\u201d actually benefitted groups and entities connected to Trump\u2019s family and friends.\u201cNot only was there the Big Lie, there was the Big Ripoff,\u201d said Rep. Zoe Lofgren, D-Calif., a member of the panel.After the hearing on Monday, Lofgren said on CNN that Donald Trump Jr.\u2019s girlfriend, Kimberly Guilfoyle, was paid $60,000 for a short speech at Trump\u2019s rally ahead of the insurrection.While some of the committee\u2019s findings are new, some of the evidence they are presenting is not. But the seven Democrats and two Republicans on the panel want to remind the public of what happened that January day _ not only how violent it was, but the lies that led up to it.At the initial hearing on June 9, the panel showed new video of police officers being beaten as Trump\u2019s supporters broke into the Capitol and interrupted the certification of Biden\u2019s victory. Images from body cameras and security video showed the huge and angry crowd as it surged toward the entrances and shattered windows and doors, repeating Trump\u2019s claims about fraud.Capitol Police officer Caroline Edwards described a bloody \u201cwar scene\u201d and hours of hand to hand combat. She was one of the first officers injured, thrown to ground as the first rioters pushed past bike racks. She suffered a head injury and still hasn\u2019t yet returned to the same unit.\u201cIt was carnage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was chaos.\u201dWhile the schedule is fluid, the committee plans up to five additional hearings to lay out its findings. While the first two hearings showed the violence of the siege and documented Trump\u2019s resistance as his aides and allies initially tried to present the facts of his November loss, future hearings will describe how he continued to push the lies and eventually set his sights on the congressional certification of Jan. 6.On Thursday, the panel will describe Trump\u2019s efforts to persuade Vice President Mike Pence to illegally delay the electoral count or to object to Biden\u2019s win as he presided over the congressional certification. In a video posted to Twitter on Tuesday, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the committee\u2019s Republican co-chair, said the panel will examine Trump\u2019s \u201crelentless effort on Jan. 6, and in the days beforehand, to pressure Vice President Pence to refuse to count lawful electoral votes.\u201dRep. Cheney also included a preview clip: former White House lawyer Eric Herschmann telling the committee in a video interview that he had told John Eastman, a lawyer who was working with Trump to push the false fraud claims, that he needed to \u201cget a great effing criminal defense lawyer. You\u2019re gonna need it.\u201dOther hearings will review Trump\u2019s pressure on Justice Department officials and what was happening in the White House as the violence unfolded at the Capitol.\u201cThe Trump campaign legal team knew there was no legitimate argument \u2014 fraud, irregularities or anything \u2014 to overturn the election,\u201d Cheney said at Monday\u2019s hearing. \u201cAnd yet President Trump went ahead with his plans for Jan. 6 anyway.\u201dAfter the hearings, the committee says its investigation will continue. And panel members will ultimately have to make a decision about whether they have found criminal activity and, if so, whether they should refer it to the Justice Department. The department, which is conducting its own investigation, could take or leave the recommendation.Committee members have been debating that issue, but have emphasized a referral is not their main goal.\u201cWe\u2019re making a report to the American people about what happened, why it happened and how we need to protect ourselves in the future,\u201d said Maryland Rep.
