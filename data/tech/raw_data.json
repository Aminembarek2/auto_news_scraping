Advanced Micro Devices (AMD.O) slumped more than 9% on Wednesday after a dour forecast.\"While we believe investors were expecting a miss, this was admittedly a somewhat sobering report,\" said Bernstein analysts, among the 13 brokerages that cut price targets on Qualcomm's stock.The company blamed the weakness on the timing of purchases by a customer that only buys its cellular modems and China, where an expected post-COVID recovery was yet to materialize.Qualcomm did not name the modem customer, but analysts pointed to Apple, which will report results after markets close.\"The next two quarterly estimates will be adversely impacted by Apple as this leading modem-only customer purchased modems from Qualcomm in greater volumes earlier than normal due to the supply chain issues,\" said Michael Walkley of Canaccord Genuity.China will remain a headache with no timeline for a recovery there, while competition is deepening from Taiwan's MediaTek (2454.TW) in the high-end smartphone chips, analysts said.\"We worry about customers mixing lower now that wafers are no longer scarce as well as increasing competition from Mediatek at the higher end,\" brokerage Evercore ISI said.Still, there were some encouraging signs for Qualcomm.Automotive revenue jumped 20% and the internet-of-things unit reported in line sales, indicating that Qualcomm's efforts to diversify away from the smartphone market were on track.Reporting by Aditya Soni; Editing by Sriraj Kalluvila", "image": null, "time": "2 minute read"}, {"title": "Impact Nano, chip materials startup, wins funding from Intel, Goldman Sachs", "description": "OAKLAND, California, May 4 (Reuters) - Impact Nano, a Massachusetts-based startup that makes specialty chemicals for the semiconductor industry and others, said on Thursday it raised $32 million in funding from investors including Intel Capital and Goldman Sachs Asset Management.It also said Intel Capital's managing director, Sean Doyle, will join the board of directors.As the U.S. tries to bring back semiconductor manufacturing with the CHIPS and Science Act, it will need to invest in building up the broader supply chain in addition to the multibillion-dollar chip fabrication facilities.The war in Ukraine has exposed several choke points on the chemical side of the chip industry that need to be fixed.

While Italy later lifted the ban, the move inspired fellow European privacy regulators to launch investigations.Lawyer Verity Egerton-Doyle at Linklaters said the review would give Britain's competition regulator the chance to join the debate.\"The EU's Digital Markets Act that came fully into force this week does not cover generative AI and the CMA no doubt sees this as an opportunity to be leading the global debate on these issues - along with the U.S. FTC which is already looking at the area,\" she said.Reporting by Muvija M; Editing by Kate Holton", "image": null, "time": "3 minute read"}, {"title": "White House to meet Microsoft, Google CEOs on AI dangers", "description": "WASHINGTON, May 4 (Reuters) - The White House will host CEOs of top artificial intelligence companies, including Alphabet Inc's Google (GOOGL.O) and Microsoft (MSFT.O), on Thursday to discuss risks and safeguards as the technology catches the attention of governments and lawmakers globally.Generative artificial intelligence has become a buzzword this year, with apps such as ChatGPT capturing the public's fancy, sparking a rush among companies to launch similar products they believe will change the nature of work.Millions of users have begun testing such tools, which supporters say can make medical diagnoses, write screenplays, create legal briefs and debug software, leading to growing concern about how the technology could lead to privacy violations, skew employment decisions, and power scams and misinformation campaigns.\"We aim to have a frank discussion about the risks we see in current and near-term AI development,\" said a senior administration official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter. \"Our North Star here is this idea that if we're going to seize these benefits, we have to start by managing the risks.\"Thursday's meeting, will include Google's Sundar Pichai, Microsoft's Satya Nadella, OpenAI's Sam Altman and Anthropic's Dario Amodei along with Vice President Kamala Harris and administration officials including Biden's Chief of Staff Jeff Zients, National Security Adviser Jake Sullivan, Director of the National Economic Council Lael Brainard and Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.Ahead of the meeting, the administration announced a $140 million investment from the National Science Foundation to launch seven new AI research institutes and said the White House's Office of Management and Budget would release policy guidance on the use of AI by the federal government.Leading AI developers, including Anthropic, Google, Hugging Face, NVIDIA, OpenAI, and Stability AI, will participate in a public evaluation of their AI systems at the AI Village at DEFCON 31 - one of the largest hacker conventions in the world - and run on a platform created by Scale AI and Microsoft.Shortly after Biden announced his reelection bid, Republican National Committee produced a video featuring a dystopian future during a second Biden term, that was built entirely with AI imagery.Such political ads are expected to become more common as AI technology proliferates.United States regulators have fallen short of the tough approach European governments have taken on tech regulation and in crafting strong rules on deep fakes and misinformation that companies must follow or risk hefty fines.\"We don't see this as a race,\" the administration official said, adding that the administration is working closely with the US-EU Trade & Technology Council on the issue.In February, Biden signed an executive order directing federal agencies to eliminate bias in their use of AI.

But it also highlights challenges as Russia's tech development becomes increasingly reliant on one state-owned player.Sberbank's almost $530 billion in assets and 107 million retail clients underline its banking credentials. Since 2020 it has cast itself as a technology company as well, and is now seeking a bigger slice of Russia's shrinking technology pie.Even as the bank's profits slumped almost 80% in 2022, hammered by Western sanctions, investments in technology have remained high, the bank's Chief Technology Officer Andrei Belevtsev told Reuters, without giving concrete figures.\"Last year, 85% of (global tech) vendors and producers refused to work with Russia, but this in no way affected our work,\" Belevtsev said in a recent interview at his skyscraper offices overlooking Moscow's financial district.The message, as with most sectors of the Russian economy, is one of defiance.Belevtsev presented the past year as little more than a bump in the road for Russian tech, and laid out previously unreported details of Sberbank's domestic technology strategy and its hopes for further cooperation with China on open source technology.Russia, nevertheless, has acknowledged major shortcomings with its electronics industry. Imports of micro chips and other high-tech hardware crucial for weapons and car manufacturing have dried up and hundreds of thousands of workers, including many in the tech sector, have moved abroad.Belevtsev would not say how Sberbank, which operates supercomputers, gets access to micro chips, imports of which are subject to sanctions. Gref in April identified graphics cards as the trickiest hardware to replace.\"There are restrictions on some of them, it is a very complex technology,\" Belevtsev said. \"Every company has its commercial secrets, suppliers and supply chains.\"He declined to say whether the bank used so-called parallel imports, those that have been brought into the country without the licence holder's permission - an increasingly important market in post-sanctions Russia.CHINA COOPERATIONEven with supply issues, Sberbank has accelerated a drive to migrate to in-house technology and is ready to sell software domestically and for export if possible, Belevtsev said.\"Many countries are determining what they are ready to do and what they are not,\" he said. \"People are interested in Russia as a technology supplier and producer.\"One key market is China. Moscow is becoming more dependent on Beijing, having sharply raised its use of the yuan, increased energy supplies to China and started selling more Chinese-branded cars as Western automakers leave Russia.\"There is already a lot of cooperation on engineers and technology,\" Belevtsev said. \"We would like to see active cooperation on open source solutions ... not just between Russia and China, but in all countries of the world.\"But with that cooperation yet to take off, Sberbank's near-term future may be limited to the domestic market, where economic growth is likely to be minimal at best, as disposable incomes stagnate.Belevtsev, who said Sberbank had sold around 1.5 million smart devices since launching them less than three years ago, believes that consumers will always save up enough to buy a smart television, Russians' \"window onto the world\".\"Go to a remote Russian village,\" he said. \"If there is electricity there, you will certainly see a satellite dish.\"Our target is to sell hundreds of thousands of televisions this year.\"To do that, and seize market share abandoned by departing Western rivals, Sberbank is playing catch up with market leader Yandex (YNDX.O).That task is challenging as Yandex is developing carefully and unhurriedly in smart devices, whereas Sberbank - while taking the right steps - is trying to move faster, said Sergei Polovnikov, head of Content Review, a technology-focused publication.\"Sberbank has big ambitions and, most importantly, a bottomless wallet,\" said Polovnikov. \"You can get a lot done with money.\"(This story has been officially corrected to say that the company refused to work with Russia, not Sberbank, in paragraph 6)($1 = 79.3000 roubles)Reporting by Alexander Marrow; Editing by Mike Collett-White and Mark PotterAlexander MarrowThomson Reuters", "image": null, "time": "4 minute read"}, {"title": "TrendForce says SK Hynix to raise legacy chip output capacity in China", "description": "SEOUL, May 4 (Reuters) - South Korea's SK Hynix Inc (000660.KS) plans to expand its legacy chip production capacity at its chip manufacturing facilities in Wuxi, China, market research firm TrendForce said.The world's second-biggest memory chip maker's long-term strategy involves shifting its capacity expansion back to South Korea, while its Wuxi chip production site caters to domestic demand in China and the legacy DRAM memory chip market, the TrendForce report said.SK Hynix did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment on Thursday.

The curbs include access to details on some companies' shareholding structures.Shanghai-based Wind has made part of its data such as home sale numbers, which used to be updated regularly, inaccessible for users based outside mainland China since September last year, one of the sources said.A Wind salesperson told the source in September the company had made the changes as per instructions from the Cyberspace Administration of China (CAC), which asked it to stop providing offshore users with certain data.The second source was also told by another Wind salesperson that the restrictions were put in place after the CAC unveiled new data rules last year.The cybersecurity regulator issued final rules last July requiring data exports to undergo security reviews, as part of a new regulatory framework that will affect hundreds, if not thousands, of Chinese companies.The new rules came in to effect from Sept. 1.Beijing has in recent years issued new cybersecurity, data and privacy laws that require organisations with large user bases to undergo assessments and approvals when handling the data they collect.Lawmakers also passed a wide-ranging update to Beijing's anti-espionage legislation late last month, banning the transfer of any information related to national security and broadening the definition of spying.The restrictions on offshore users' access to certain Wind data have expanded since last September, said the first source. It is unknown whether the CAC stepped up access tightening requirements since the same month.So far, offshore users' access to Wind information that has been blocked includes business registry details such as a company shareholding structure and its ultimate controller, as well as economic data such as home and land sales in certain cities, sources have told Reuters.Wind, which serves numerous domestic and foreign financial institutions, did not respond to requests for comment.The CAC did not immediately respond to a faxed request for comment.When asked about Chinese financial data providers including Wind having stopped providing key corporate information to overseas subscribers, foreign ministry spokesperson Mao Ning told a news briefing that she was not aware of the situation.The sources declined to be identified as they were not authorised to speak to the media.Founded in 1998 by entrepreneur Lu Feng, private-held Wind is by far the biggest player in China's fast-growing market for financial data, as per estimates by broker Guotai Junan Securities.LIMITED ACCESSBusiness groups have warned about the vague wording of China's new anti-espionage law, which bans the transfer of any information related to national security, the rise in use of exit bans on foreign business executives in the country and heightened scrutiny toward due diligence firms.U.S. due-diligence firm Mintz Group said in late March the authorities had raided the firm's China office and detained five local staff.
