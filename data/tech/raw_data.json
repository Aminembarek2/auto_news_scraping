The agency did not immediately identify who was at fault in crashes and will release more detailed information on individual incidents later on Wednesday.The agency emphasized crashes are tracked by individual automakers in different ways and discouraged comparisons of performance among automakers in part because there aren't comprehensive metrics on how widely each system is used.The agency said out of 130 crashes reported involving automated driving systems, 108 involved no injuries and one was a serious injury crash.Tesla, Cruise and Waymo did not immediately respond to requests for comment.Japan's Honda told Reuters it had found no defects in the systems and its crash reports were based on unverified customer statements \"to comply with NHTSA\u2019s 24-hour reporting deadline.\"No other automaker reported more than 10 ADAS crashes during the period.Despite the limitations, NHTSA said the data was essential in order to quickly spot potential defects or safety trends. Incidents that occur when an advanced system was engaged within 30 seconds of a crash must be reported within 24 hours to NHTSA.\"By providing NHTSA with critical and timely safety data this will help our investigators quickly identify potential defect trends,\" NHTSA Administrator Steven Cliff told reporters.

The lure of big profits has led individual investors to pour assets into Celsius and platforms like it. Its CEO Alex Mashinsky said in October Celsius had $25 billion in assets, although that had fallen to around $11.8 billion as of last month, its website showed.Celsius appears to have stumbled on its wholesale crypto investments, according to public blockchain information and analysts who track such data. As those investments soured, the company was unable to meet redemptions from customers fleeing amid the broader crypto market slump, analysts said.\u201cThis is the closest we've seen to a bank run\u201d in the cryptocurrency sector, said Noelle Acheson, head of market insights at Genesis, a digital currency prime brokerage.Mashinsky and a representative for Celsius did not respond to requests for comment. The company said on Sunday it was taking steps to meet redemptions but \"there may be delays.\"Celsius' problems date back to at least December when, at the hands of hackers, it lost $54 million worth of bitcoin it had invested with DeFi platform BadgerDao, according to public blockchain data. At the time, Mashinsky said Celsius lost money, but did not disclose how much.Celsius had also invested in the Anchor protocol which offered up to 20% returns on deposits of TerraUSD. As TerraUSD fell, Celsius pulled more than $535 million in crypto assets from Anchor, according to public blockchain data.  read more Mashinsky said in a May interview that its exposure to TerraUSD was small relative to its assets but did not say if the company had lost money.loadingThe company's biggest misstep, though, appears to have been its decision to invest customers' ether tokens with Lido Finance, a DeFi platform offering investors the chance to profit from a new version of ether that is in development. The investments are known as \"staked\" ether, or stETH.Celsius promised customers between 6% and 8% returns on ether deposits. It had at least $450 million in stETH in its primary DeFi wallet, but likely has more stored elsewhere, according to Andrew Thurman, an analyst at analytics firm Nansen, which tracks blockchain data.While one stETH is supposed to be redeemable for one ether, stETH's price has dropped compared to ether in recent weeks as the crypto market fall prompted holders to dump their stETH.That discrepancy will have made it difficult for Celsius to convert its stETH back to ether to meet customer withdrawals, said analysts.\u201cEverybody ... could see that they had positions that were significantly under risk,\u201d said Thurman.The slump in bitcoin, which has shed about half its value this year, has also pressured Celsius. It pledged crypto assets pegged to bitcoin as collateral against a loan of other cryptocurrencies, according to Thurman. As bitcoin fell, Celsius had to top up that collateral, said Thurman.In 2019, Mashinsky told the Financial Times that Celsius had crypto loans collateralized with bitcoin.\"The whole thing is just mispriced risk,\" Cory Klippsten, CEO of crypto investment platform Swan Bitcoin, said of Celsius' business model.CONTAGION WORRIESCelsius has hired restructuring lawyers, the Wall Street Journal reported Tuesday. Its problems have sparked fears that other crypto lending platforms may be at risk of investor runs.On Tuesday, the chair of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission said such platforms operate a bit like banks and that promised high returns might be \"too good to be true.\"  read more Celsius' peers have been quick to distance themselves from stETH. On Monday, New Jersey-based BlockFi tweeted it does not hold any stETH principally or as collateral. Voyager Digital, also New Jersey-based, tweeted it has never engaged in DeFi lending activities and has no exposure to stETH.But according to Thurman, several other crypto lending platforms, such as Aave, invest in stETH and pledge it as collateral.

Since February, the total funding allocated to the companies has increased by almost half in order to cope with the rise in demand in Russia, the five people familiar with the matter told Reuters.The funding flows through the U.S. Agency for Global Media (USAGM) \u2013 a federal agency that oversees U.S. government-backed broadcasters, including Voice of America and Radio Free Europe/Radio Liberty \u2013 as well as via the Washington-based OTF, which is funded entirely by the U.S. government and overseen by the USAGM.Laura Cunningham, president of the OTF, said the organization had increased its support to the three VPNs because \"the Russian government is attempting to censor what their citizens can see and say online in order to obscure the truth and silence dissent.\"Censorship evasion tools, including the VPNs, backed by OTF averaged more than 4 million users last month in Russia, Cunningham added.In a statement, USAGM also said it was supporting the development of a range of censorship circumvention tools, including VPNs. It also did not give precise data on their funding.\"With the Kremlin's escalating crackdown on media freedom, we've seen an extraordinary surge in demand for these tools among Russians,\" USAGM spokesperson Laurie Moy said.Russia's foreign ministry did not respond to an emailed request for comment. In a statement, the Kremlin rejected allegations of online censorship: \"We don't censor the Internet. Russia regulates certain Web resources, like many other countries in the world.\"Martin Zhu, director of engineering at nthLink, said his app's daily users in Russia had recently soared after it was promoted heavily by U.S. government-funded news websites such as Voice of America: \"The graph went from 1,000 one day to 10,000 the next day, to 30,000 the day after that, to 50,000 and straight up.\"\"There are a lot of people in Russia who don't trust Putin, and government media,\" he said.Zhu, who shared confidential data with Reuters that illustrated this spike in users, said his company would normally struggle to operate inside Russia without financial support from the U.S. government.Nigel Gibbs, a public affairs officer for VOA, said that it regularly promotes the three VPNs on its network, and had integrated one of them, Psiphon, directly into the VOA smartphone app.Mike Hull, CEO of Toronto-headquartered Psiphon, said that the recent U.S. government financing had been \"instrumental.\" He said more than 1.3 million Russians a day were using Psiphon's network.At Lantern, an executive at the company, who asked not to be identified for security concerns, said it had added 1.5 million monthly users in Russia since the start of the war, from a previous base of around five million global monthly users, thanks to promotion on U.S. government media and also word of mouth on the messaging app Telegram, which is popular in Russia.VPN POSTERSPosters advertising nthLink and other U.S.-government backed VPNs, as well as independent Russian-language media outlets, have appeared in Moscow since the start of the war, according to three people familiar with the matter.One homemade poster pasted in a Moscow apartment building in the month after the invasion said: \"Read about Russia and Ukraine in Russian. Knowing the truth is not a crime!\" Below that a QR code links to nthLink, according to a photo of the poster reviewed by Reuters that was corroborated by three separate sources.Reuters was unable to determine the exact location of the poster nor who hung it. The mayor's office in Moscow and local police did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the posters.Opening nthLink in Russia leads users to a series of recent news headlines, including updates about Moscow's war in Ukraine, from U.S. government-funded news websites.Long before Moscow launched what it calls a \"special military operation\" in Ukraine, Russian authorities had been pressuring domestic media they viewed as hostile and foreign-backed by designating some media outlets and journalists as \"foreign agents\".In an escalation of that pressure, Russia's parliament passed a law in March that allows journalists to be jailed for up to 15 years for spreading intentionally \"fake\" news about the Russian military.Moscow also cut access to several foreign media websites, including the BBC and Voice of America, on March 4 for spreading what it alleged was false information about its war in Ukraine. At the time, VOA and BBC both strongly denied the claim.As early as 2017, Putin signed a law which prohibited the use of VPNs and in 2019 Russia threatened to completely block access to a string of popular VPNs. Even so, the apps have continued to be quietly used in Russia.CRACKDOWNThe demand for VPNs in Russia skyrocketed in March when Moscow introduced restrictions on some foreign social media, including Facebook and Instagram.On the eve of the ban, VPN demand spiked 2,088% higher than the daily average demand in mid-February, data from London-based monitoring firm Top10VPN showed.  read more \"The need to look for a VPN arose with the blocks on Instagram, Facebook, Twitter,\" said a resident of Oryol, a city 200 miles (320 km) south of Moscow, who declined to give his full name for fear of retribution.He said that while he could access social media in Moscow, when he returned to Oryol they were blocked. \"Then I came across Psiphon and strangely enough it worked in both Moscow and Oryol: no glitches; always connected.\"Authorities in Moscow and Oryol did not respond to requests for comment.Though interest in VPNs has recently eased somewhat, daily usage is still up 452% on average compared to the week before war broke out, according to Simon Migliano, Head of Research at Top10VPN.\"We conservatively estimate that at least 6 million VPNs have been installed since the invasion,\" Migliano said.Russia's population is around 144 million, with an estimated 85% having access to the Internet, according to World Bank data from 2020.Reporting by James Pearson in London and Christopher Bing in Washington; Additional reporting by Guy Faulconbridge in London; Editing by Chris Sanders and Daniel Flynn", "image": null, "time": "June 15, 2022"}, {"title": "Crypto giant Binance opens 2,000 positions for hiring - CEO", "description": "June 15 (Reuters) - Cryptocurrency exchange Binance has opened 2,000 positions for hiring, Chief Executive Officer Changpeng Zhao said on Wednesday, a sharp contrast to a slew of job cuts by companies operating in the digital currency space.\"It was not easy saying no to Super bowl ads, stadium naming rights, large sponsor deals a few months ago, but we did.

Still, it expects annual sales of such cars to reach only 3.5 million vehicles by the end of the decade, or around a third of current sales.Just last month, Toyota rolled out its first mass-produced all-electric vehicle domestically, albeit for lease only, and gasoline-electric hybrid models remain far more popular in Japan.  read more NEXT CEOAsked about succession planning, Chief Executive Akio Toyoda, who has led the company for 13 years, said he was \"thinking about timing and the selection of a successor.\"There has been no indication that Toyoda plans to step down.Toyoda, 66, a grandson of company founder Kiichiro Toyoda, steered the company through a dark phase when Toyota sales slumped after the recall of millions of vehicles and the company reported billions of dollars in losses.\"I'd pick someone who understands the company's philosophy as my successor,\" he added.Toyoda has sought to reform Toyota's corporate culture, spending more time with younger executives and cutting back some senior positions.In 2020, he appointed company veterans Maeda and Kenta Kon to top roles. Both were 51 at the time - a relatively young age for top Toyota executives.Toyota - which sold 10.5 million vehicles in 2021, far outstripping closest rival Volkswagen AG (VOWG_p.DE) - has repeatedly cut production this year, plagued by a global chip crunch.It expects the chip shortage to continue, although there are signs of improvement, head of its purchasing group, Kazunari Kumakura, said on Wednesday.Reporting by Satoshi Sugiyama; Editing by Sayantani Ghosh and Richard Pullin", "image": null, "time": "June 15, 2022"}, {"title": "EXCLUSIVE Baidu in talks to sell majority stake in iQIYI, China's answer to Netflix -sources", "description": "SummaryCompaniesBaidu plans to sell all its holdings in iQIYI -sourcesStake sale could value iQIYI at about $7 bln -sourcesTargeted iQIYI value would represent price of $8.13/shareDeal has drawn interest from PAG and China Mobile -sourcesHONG KONG, June 15 (Reuters) - China's internet search engine giant Baidu Inc is in talks to sell its controlling stake in iQIYI Inc (IQ.O), China's answer to Netflix, in a deal that could value all of iQIYI at about $7 billion, two people with knowledge of the matter said.Baidu, which owns 53% of iQIYI and holds more than 90% of its shareholder voting rights, plans to sell all its holdings in the Chinese video streaming services firm, the two people and another two sources familiar with the matter said.While cinemas have struggled with COVID-19 lockdowns, China's online video market is booming. Domestic consulting firm Zhiyan forecasts 2022 revenue is set to climb to 163 billion yuan ($24 billion), up 17% year-on-year.Nasdaq-listed iQIYI, the No. 2 player in China's video streaming market after Tencent Holdings' (0700.HK) Tencent Video, has a market value of $4 billion. Baidu's targeted valuation of $7 billion for the whole company in its divestment would represent a price of about $8.13 per share compared with its latest close of $4.67.The divestment plan, not previously disclosed by Baidu, comes after the firm deemed iQIYI to be a non-core asset, and as it seeks to sharpen its focus on developing its capital-intensive artificial intelligence and autonomous driving units, the first two sources said.  read more Terms of the deal have not yet been finalised and are subject to change, said the sources, who declined to be identified due to confidentiality constraints.Baidu did not respond to a request for comment.\"This is purely market rumour,\" iQIYI said in an emailed statement to Reuters, without providing further comment.The iQIYI stake has drawn initial interest from a number of financial sponsors and state-owned companies, said three of the sources, including Hong Kong-based private equity firm PAG.China Mobile (0941.HK), the world's largest mobile network operator by subscribers and owner of streaming service Migu Video, is also among potential buyers, two of the people with knowledge of the matter said.PAG declined to comment. China Mobile did not respond to a request for comment.If Baidu achieves its valuation target, that would represent a premium of more than 100% to iQIYI's average share price over the past three months of $3.97. The streaming firm's shares have lost 70% in the past year amid a broader Chinese tech sell-off.U.S.-listed shares of iQIYI were down 4.7%, while Baidu rose 4% in premarket trading on Wednesday.Baidu, whose businesses range from internet search to electric vehicles, with expansion into cloud services, robotaxis and autonomous driving in recent years, has tapped Bank of America (BAC.N) to work on the potential sale, the second pair of sources said.Bank of America did not offer any immediate comment.IQIYI HITS, LOSSESThe stake sale plan drawn up by Baidu, worth nearly $50 billion by market value, comes against the backdrop of China's regulatory crackdown since late 2020 on firms from technology, private education and other sectors, which hammered their shares and forced some to scale back expansion in non-core areas.The Nasdaq Golden Dragon Index, which tracks Chinese companies traded on Wall Street, is down 50% over the past year.Snaring iQIYI would give a potential buyer the chance to dive into the main market for full-length TV shows and movies.Tencent Video and iQIYI, as well as smaller rival Youku, owned by Alibaba Group Holding (9988.HK), offer movies, drama series and reality shows - both original content and material bought from other producers.iQIYI has made several hit drama series, including \"The Long Night\" and \"The Wind Blows From Longxi\". Its original variety shows, \"The Rap of China\" and \"The Big Band\", have also been major topics on social media.On the flip side, cash-burning iQIYI has barely broken even in its 12-year history.

As time ran out, WTO members should consider meeting halfway, he added.The WTO agreed in 1998 to a moratorium on e-commerce tariffs and repeatedly extended it at ministerial conferences, which the Geneva-based trade body normally holds every two years.Now India, Indonesia and South Africa were threatening to block an extension, trade sources close to talks at the WTO said. This raises the prospect that tariffs could be imposed on such data flows as music streaming and financial transactions.That possibility has prompted 108 tech company associations, including groups from India and Indonesia, to write to the WTO urging members to renew the moratorium, saying failure to do so would be a historic setback for the WTO and would undermine the global recovery.Small developing countries, they say, would lose the chance to increase their digital competitiveness without a moratorium.John Neuffer, chief executive of the U.S.-based Semiconductor Industry Association, said tariff-free data flows were essential for countries wishing to attract foreign. They also offered clear benefits to consumers and small businesses, he said.\"We heard alarm bells that things were in trouble, with much more risk of the moratorium not being extended,\" Neuffer told Reuters. \"The risk is that if one or two go, it sets off a torrent of efforts by other countries to do the same thing\" - impose tariffs.Studies demonstrated that tariff revenue benefits would be outweighed by economic losses, he said.An EU official said countries favouring a moratorium extension were still hoping for a multilateral deal.
