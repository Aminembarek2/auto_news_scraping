No.2 token ether dropped as much as 16% to $1,177, its lowest since January 2021.Crypto markets have dived in the past few weeks as rising interest rates and surging inflation hurt riskier assets across financial markets. The collapse in May of the terraUSD and luna tokens also shook the industry.  read more \"It's still an uncomfortable moment, and there's some contagion risk around crypto more broadly,\" said Joseph Edwards, head of financial strategy at fund management firm Solrise Finance.Celsius offers interest-bearing products to customers who deposit cryptocurrencies at its platform, and then lends out cryptocurrencies to earn a return.In a blog post, the company said it had frozen withdrawals, as well as transfers between accounts, \"to stabilise liquidity and operations while we take steps to preserve and protect assets.\"\"We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honour, over time, its withdrawal obligations,\" the New Jersey-based company said.'GREY AREA'The surge of interest in crypto lending led to concerns from regulators, especially in the United States, who are worried about investor protections and systemic risks from unregulated lending products.  read more Celsius and crypto firms that offer services similar to banks are in a \"grey area\" of regulations, said Matthew Nyman at CMS law firm. \"They\u2019re not subject to any clear regulation that requires disclosure\" over their assets.Celsius CEO Alex Mashinsky and Celsius did not immediately respond to Reuters requests for comment outside U.S. business hours.Celsius raised $750 million in funding late in November from investors, including Canada's second-largest pension fund Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec. Celsius was valued at the time at $3.25 billion.As of May 17, Celsius had $11.8 billion in assets, its website said, down by more than half from October, and had processed a total of $8.2 billion worth of loans.Mashinsky, the CEO, was quoted in October last year saying Celsius had more than $25 billion in assets.The company's website, which urges customers to \"Earn high.

Rune Labs Chief Executive Brian Pepin told Reuters in an interview the Apple Watch data will be combined with data from other sources, including a Medtronic (MDT.N) implant that can measure brain signals.Rune Labs' goal is for doctors to use the combined data to decide whether and how to fine-tune the patients' treatment, an approach called precision medicine. At present, Pepin said, most doctors have to gather data on a patient's movements by observing the patient during a short clinical visit, which is not ideal because Parkinson's symptoms can vary widely over time.The Apple Watch will give doctors a continuous stream of observations over long stretches, Pepin said.\"When you think about the process of getting someone to their optimal therapy or combination of drugs or devices, or even whether or not a patient might be a good fit for certain clinical trial, it's a very hard decision to make when you only have a little context,\" Pepin said.The Rune Labs FDA clearance is the first prominent use of software tools that Apple released for measuring movement disorders in 2018.Last year, a group of scientists at Apple published a study in the journal Science Translational Medicine showing the device was effective at monitoring Parkinson's symptoms.

Musk wants to show customers that Starship, which he sees as humanity's path to Mars, can successfully reach orbit, a long-delayed pivotal milestone in the rocket's development.SpaceX's proposals to address NASA's concerns, which include a plan to be able to launch U.S. astronauts from a different launchpad in Florida, could take months to get agency approval.SpaceX last year accelerated construction of an orbital Starship launchpad at its facilities in Cape Canaveral, Florida, as an alternative to the rocket's primary test launch and development site in Boca Chica, Texas, which has been subject to a lengthy regulatory review set to conclude next week.But one of SpaceX's existing Florida facilities, called Launch Complex 39A, at NASA's Kennedy Space Center on the coast of Cape Canaveral, is the only pad approved to launch the company's Crew Dragon capsule. NASA depends on that spacecraft to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station.NASA officials in recent months have told SpaceX that a Starship explosion at Launch Complex 39A could effectively cut off the space agency's sole means of launching U.S. astronauts to the International Space Station.\"We all recognize that if you had an early failure like we did on one of the early SpaceX flights, it would be pretty devastating to 39A,\" Kathy Lueders, NASA's space operations chief, said in an interview of the agency's discussions with SpaceX.SpaceX did not return a request for comment.SpaceX has already invested heavily in building a Starship pad some hundreds of feet from pad 39A's launch tower. It has responded by pitching NASA on a plan to outfit its other Florida pad - Launch Complex 40, five miles away on Space Force property - with the means to launch U.S. astronauts, according to a person familiar with the plans.The company is also studying ways to \"harden\" 39A, or make the launchpad more resilient to both an explosive Starship accident and the immense forces emitted from a successful Starship liftoff, Lueders said.Hardening the 39A pad and launching humans from pad 40 would both require agency approval.\"SpaceX is working with us on those things,\" said Lueders. \"Because it\u2019s also in their best interest to not have what is a pretty steady source of income for them become interrupted.\"Part of SpaceX's challenge is to show that 39A will not be damaged by Starship's novel liquid oxygen and methane fuel - a combination of propellants that NASA and U.S. regulators are not familiar with.\"The problem is the explosive potential for that combination is not well known,\" said Randy Repcheck, a deputy manager in the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) Office of Commercial Space Transportation, which oversees launchpad safety.Starship is a two-stage reusable rocket system designed to launch commercial satellites to Earth orbit and humans to the moon and Mars. NASA last year picked SpaceX to use Starship for the agency's first launch of U.S. astronauts to the lunar surface since the days of the Apollo program.The rocket's next big test, a complex task of launching to orbit for the first time, has been delayed in part by the regulatory review of the Texas compound's environmental impact, which has precluded the FAA from granting SpaceX its orbital launch license.Set to conclude Monday, the review is expected to place conditions on SpaceX that could add delays to its Starship program. That prospect led Musk to double down last year on construction of Starship's launchpad at 39A in Florida at Cape Canaveral.\u201cWe do have the alternative of the Cape, and we actually applied for environmental approval for launch from the Cape a few years ago and received it,\" Musk said at a \"Starship Update\" event in February, estimating it would take \"six to eight months to build up the Cape launch tower and launch from there.\u201dReporting by Joey Roulette; Editing by Leslie Adler", "image": "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/P4UD3PTNIBPIJLZG54EGRVK2OY.jpg", "time": "June 13, 2022"}, {"title": "Geely founder's venture buys majority stake in Chinese smartphone maker Meizu", "description": "SHANGHAI, June 13 (Reuters) - A venture run by the founder of Chinese automaker Zhejiang Geely Holding (GEELY.UL) plans to acquire an 79% stake in Chinese smartphone maker Meizu, a statement published by China's anti-monopoly regulator showed on Monday.The State Administration of Market Regulation said that Hubei Xingji Shidai Technology Co Ltd had agreed to purchase the stake from two of Meizu's shareholders.

Shares in the company have been almost flat in the past 12 months, versus an 18% drop for the European auto index (.SXAP) and a 13% drop for the luxury index (.STXLUXP).Rival Aston Martin lost almost 70% over the same period, while Tesla (TSLA.O) shares were among the few to outperform Ferrari.But Vigna has something to prove.\"A lot is riding on the upcoming Capital Market Day to change valuation parameters for a business which seems to have been on autopilot in recent years and may need a transformational strategy,\" analysts at Jefferies said.($1 = 0.9510 euros)Additional reporting by Stefano Bernabei\nEditing by Keith Weir and Mark Potter", "image": null, "time": "June 13, 2022"}, {"title": "Lawmakers urge USTR to push for extension of WTO's moratorium on digital trade", "description": "WASHINGTON, June 13 (Reuters) -

These talks are still in preliminary stages, cautions one source with direct knowledge of the situation.They are also discussing a game or virtual world inspired by \"Battle of the Planets,\" an iconic Japanese anime show from the 1970s that AGBO is developing as a feature film.Mahoney hopes to leverage Nexon's experience in operating \"live games\" - updating titles while they are running - to launch big budget titles with a Western sensibility, such as the free-to-play shooter game \"ARC Raiders,\" from Embark Studios.Embark's founder, Patrick Soderlund, once led Dice, the company that developed the \"Battlefield\" franchise and was acquired by Electronic Arts (EA.O) when Mahoney was head of mergers and acquisitions there.VIRTUAL WORLD PIONEERNexon has assiduously avoided the frenzy around the \"metaverse\" that has gripped tech giants Microsoft and Facebook.\"Nobody can define it and most importantly they can't define why it's so darn great,\" Mahoney said. \"It's a big nothingburger.\"Nexon was an early adopter of features that have become common in the industry including in-game virtual currencies and the free-to-play business model.These features were rolled out in games such as Nexon's \"KartRider\" racing game, which has been running for almost two decades - one of what the company calls its \"forever franchises.\"Its most popular franchise, the arcade-style fighting game \"Dungeon and Fighter,\" has earned more than $20 billion since 2005 - more than the combined box office proceeds of the \"Star Wars\" or \"Harry Potter\" film franchises.One big new challenge as part of Nexon's expansion will to generate returns from higher-budget Western games.\"Nexon does not have much of a track record in operating photorealistic games for hardcore gamers,\" Citigroup analysts wrote in March, initiating coverage of the stock at \"neutral\".Nexon wants to control the cost of developing titles in an era when budgets top $100 million. For instance, it uses machine learning technology to animate some character actions instead of relying on workers.\"I don't really care what happens in the first one or two quarters,\" Mahoney said. \"What I care about is what happens from years two to 20.\"Reporting by Sam Nussey in Tokyo and Dawn Chmielewski in Los Angeles; Editing by Gerry Doyle", "image": "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/YWHJ54EQSVKWNHVJMP6NIW65R4.jpg", "time": "June 12, 2022"}, {"title": "Dutch watchdog says Apple to offer other payment methods in dating apps", "description": "June 11 (Reuters) - The Netherlands' antitrust watchdog on Saturday said Apple Inc (AAPL.O) will allow different payment methods in Dutch dating applications, ending a dispute that resulted in the company being fined 50 million euros ($52.58 million).The Authority for Consumers and Markets (AMC) said in a statement that with this concession, Apple will meet the requirement that the regulator had set under the European Union and Dutch competition rules.The iPhone maker has long mandated use of its in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up 30% that some developers like Tinder owner Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) have argued are too high.\"In the digital economy, powerful companies have a special responsibility to keep the market fair and open.

They have fallen nearly 40% since Musk unveiled his stake in Twitter in early April, hurt in part by a strict lockdown in Shanghai that has affected Tesla's production.Shareholders will vote on Tesla's proposed stock split on Aug. 4. If approved, it would be the company's first such action after a five-for-one split in August 2020.  read more Tesla said the split would enable its employees to \"have more flexibility in managing their equity\" and make its stock \"more accessible to our retail shareholders.\"Alphabet Inc (GOOGL.O), Apple Inc (AAPL.O)and Amazon.com Inc(AMZN.O)have also recently split their shares.While a split has no bearing on a company's fundamentals, it could buoy the share price by making it easier for a wider range of investors to own the stock.Tesla will also ask shareholders to vote to reduce its board of directors' terms to two years from three. If approved, the terms would be staggered over two years.UNIONMeanwhile, proposals by Tesla shareholders include corporate governance-related items such as the right of employees to form a union and Tesla's efforts to prevent sexual harassment and racial discrimination.\"In 2021, the National Labor Relations Board upheld a 2019 ruling that Tesla illegally fired a worker involved in union organizing, and that the CEO had illegally threatened workers regarding unionization,\" according to a stockholder proposal cited in Tesla's filing.In March, Musk invited labor union United Auto Workers (UAW) to hold a vote at Tesla's California factory. But \"Tesla does not have any formal policy commitments to respect the right to freedom of association, nor has it demonstrated how it would effectively operationalize such a commitment,\" the proposal said.Tesla's board advised a vote against the proposal, saying Tesla recently increased the base pay for its manufacturing jobs and it is \"actively engaged\" in protecting employees' rights.Shareholders also proposed an annual report on Tesla's efforts to prevent sexual harassment and racial discrimination after it was hit by a string of lawsuits.A California civil rights agency filed a lawsuit accusing Tesla of failing for years to address widespread racist conduct at its Fremont assembly plant.Tesla said it does not \"tolerate discrimination, harassment, retaliation or any mistreatment of employees in the workplace.\"Another resolution asked Tesla to evaluate the \"impact of Tesla's current use of arbitration on the prevalence of harassment and discrimination in its workplace.\"Shareholders also called on the company to report its polices to address perceived lack of gender and racial diversity at its board.Reporting by Akash Sriram in Bengaluru and Hyunjoo Jin in San Francisco; Editing by Shinjini Ganguli, Matthew Lewis and Richard Chang", "image": "https://cloudfront-us-east-2.images.arcpublishing.com/reuters/E6MJUYOIQBICHMXH2RD3JWRGHA.jpg", "time": "June 11, 2022"}, {"title": "Apple's app store to allow more payment options for Dutch dating app developers", "description": "June 10 (Reuters) - Apple Inc (AAPL.O) on Friday laid out how developers of dating apps offered in the Netherlands can skip Apple's in-app payment systems, a closely watched step by the iPhone maker in the face of global antitrust concerns about its control over the mobile app industry.Apple has long mandated use of its in-app payment system, which charges commissions of up 30% that some developers like Tinder owner Match Group Inc (MTCH.O) have argued are too high.

Apple had previously said developers who were paying its 30% commission rate would owe it a 27% commission.But some developers already pay Apple a lower 15% commission rate when they meet certain criteria such as retaining subscription customers for more than a year.Apple's previous rules did not make clear whether those developers would also get a discount when using third-party payment services. Apple on Friday said those developers will pay a 12% commission when using outside payment systems.Apple on Friday also said that Dutch authorities mandated changes to how apps look when using third-party payments.Apple's system will show users a warning that says the user will have to contact the developer over payment problems such as asking for a refund.
